I was informed He passed away years earlier than we expected on August 21st, 2008 in Malaysia. There are photos linked from 2008 at the bottom of this page that appear to show his location of interment (you must click through the landing page): http://tathagata.info</p> <p>I have compiled this site to serve as place to collect and publish all known textual content left for us by Tathagata.</p> <p><span style=text-decoration:underline>Disclaimer</span>: Tathagata spoke virtually no English, aside from the odd word here and there. So all of the contents from him which are here, aside from those under \\\"New Translations\\\", have been translated from Tathagata's native language of Korean into English by members. I just copied them as-is.</p> <p>Reading the translations alone can only serve as a basic introduction to the true meanings of his teachings. Reading them in Korean as a native speaker with full context would generally be superior.</p> <p>The other contents under \\\"New Translations\\\" were produced by people who are unfamiliar with Tathagata and merely spoke Korean, or were produced after Tathagata died, and therefore were not checked with him. Everything published here should be considered very carefully and your initial impression of its meaning should not necessarily be believed. For example, after reading His book of poetry Traveler for about a decade, it was only after a major wake up call in my personal life that I began to read many of the poems in Chapter 8. 'Law of Cause and Effect' with meanings which were more than relatively superficial.</p> <p>All contents are Copyright &copy; 1984 - 2021,<br/>Enlightenment of Tathagata.</p> <p>All Rights Reserved.</p> <p>Any use of the articles contained in this app is prohibited under the Digital Millennium Act.

I had to undergo through many big trials before I became Enlightened. Nobody amongst you will undergo such trails.</p> <p>In fact, I had never imagined that I would attain Enlightenment until I obtained it and I was not aware that I would do any special work for this world. I had some period when I was very anxious about my situation in life that I could not do anything for others in spite of my abilities and I questioned myself about what had happened in my own life.</p> <p>I suffered extraordinary trials from my birth. I was not given any affection during my growing up. I was despised by my parents. I was looked down upon by neighbours. I faced cruelty even from my brother. Later, I was oppressed by people in power. I didn't have any school education nor any help from others. There were lots of difficulties which I had to solve by myself from my childhood. Whenever I came across the problems something mysterious happened and I was protected. I could solve all problems when I wanted.</p> <p>In the same way my Enlightenment happened. I had no problems for myself or my family at that time. However, the social circumstances prevented me from doing my daily work. Then, I was guided by my consciousness to go to a calm place. I went to a small island, named Yonwhado. I retreated to myself. I was forty-four and it was November 1984. I lived alone in a remote house. One day I had some questions - about what happened in my life. At that moment one question occurred in my consciousness, \\\"Go back to the past\\\".</p> <p>I had a next question and a new answer appeared from myself, which indicated me to go back to the world where I came from before my birth in this world. And I found myself at the entrance of the world of Enlightenment. I started to count backwards the years of my life, closing my eyes, lying down, 44, 43, 42, 41 ........ When I counted the last one, an absolutely calm world appeared in my consciousness. There was an object emitting light in the empty space. It was the only thing that I saw. Then five desires disappeared from the body, worries and illusions stopped, sadness and hate disappeared from the consciousness. After this I passed into Enlightenment.</p> <p>After some time I knew what I had to do. So I met and searched for people and I had to tell what is in truth. I looked strange in people's eyes. However, I had to inform the reality of the fact to them. Because of my pursuit my neighbours, relatives and my friends all left me. When people listened to me, most of them did not want to see me again. In spite of all this, I am still trying to tell you the things in Truth. I wonder if you will also distance yourself from me after reading this. In spite of my understanding of people's attitude, I want to reveal the reality in truth because there are some problems in the world that you have to realize and there are some answers that you don't know. It is not easy for you and anybody else to see them with human faculties. If somebody claims that he is Enlightened or that he can tell the truth, you do need to try testing and confirming such claims. He will have to show me the proof for his claims. I do not believe that there is another Enlightened Being in this age except me, that is why my mind is so anxious.</p> <p>I can't give up my work in despair and discouragement. So I have been explaining repeatedly about my Enlightenment because I wanted to help you and the things about to happen in this world. There is too big a gap between your viewpoint and mine. Thought exists in your words but truth exists in my words. That's why I look a total stranger to human eyes. Truth exists everywhere and it exists in what you are doing.</p> <p>Knowing truth is to bless oneself.</p> <p>Revealing truth is to bless this world.</p> <p>When people understand truth they don't deceive others and don't do anything harmful to others.</p> <p>When people know truth they can be free from poverty and ignorance.</p> <p>When people know truth they can find the way to eternal life and the cycle of rebirth. When people know truth they can see how the world works.</p> <p>However, If they don't have an opportunity to meet the Enlightened Being then they don't find where the truth that they are looking for is. Therefore, to gain truth from meeting the Enlightened Being is like gaining the most valuable and rare treasure in this world because it is very seldom that the Enlightened Being appears into this world. Furthermore, it is impossible for most ordinary people to meet the Enlightened Being in human society.</p> <p>I had to come into this world as there is a particular reason, because something big is to happen in this world in this age. The world has kept existing until now by Appointment. This world has been existing by the process of things dying and being reborn. We observed many a phenomenon in the matter and the creatures. All these happen by Appointment which makes this world exist. The world and all that is in this world has been existing by Appointment. The present mankind also can't escape this Appointment. You don't have any solution about this phenomenon. That's why the human world needed an Enlightened Being. Is that why I had to endure such terrible trials after my coming into this world? The reason is that there is an extremely urgent problem in our age. There are some who will die forever, there are some who will live forever. This will depend upon what is within you and what shall be in you. Your destiny is created by what is within you. Nobody can live or survive beyond and without Appointment. My coming into this world and revealing truth is to fulfill your demands and needs.</p> <p>I have not demanded anything from the people. The only thing I ask of you is your interest and assistance in my work to reveal the truth. Most people whom I have met have easily denied my Enlightenment and even ridiculed me. I know the Appointment that creates and keeps the world going. I can solve the problem that you must become aware of in your life.</p> <p>I am Tathagata.</p> <p>I am the man who came to the world to reveal things in Truth.</p> <p>To give up yourself or to save yourself, that is your own decision and you have to make that decision in this age. My message to you is that you yourself are your own Messiah who will be able to save your own life. The Messiah who some people are waiting for will never come to this world, I truly promise it. If there are some who deny my view, please show me the proof. I have never deceived others and have never done anything harmful to others in the past and will not do so in the future.</p> <p>I am sure that my Enlightenment could be beneficial for the world. If you need more explanation about my message please let me have any questions. (Sorry Due to the Death of Tathagata there we can no longer answer emails)</p> <p>I emphasize again this point - Try to see what it is, confirm what it is and judge what it is.</p> <p>This manner will be helpful for your life.</p> <p>Tathagata.</p>\";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<h3>Contents of Lectures</h3> <p>1) The secret of the world of phenomena.<br/>2) The conclusion of mankind.<br/>3) The new world through the Changing Period.<br/>4) The answer on creation and evolution.<br/>5) The things which have happened inside oneself have caused oneself to exist.<br/>6) The world of life which is seen from things in life.<br/>7) The falsehood which spoils the human world.<br/>8) The way to happiness.<br/>9) What is Truth ?<br/>10) Nirvana.<br/>11) The requirements for becoming an Enlightened Being.<br/>12) The way to Eternal Life<br/>13) What is Karma<br/>14) What is Destiny.</p> <h3>Main Contents of the Lectures</h3> <p class=\\\"blue underline\\\">How does the world exist ?</p> <p>Everything that exists in a phenomenon is made by what is in a single principle. This principle, like mathematics, makes results depending on the things in what is. The reason why the human world hasn't known this thing yet is that the problems of what is haven't been exactly perceived.</p> <p class=\\\"blue underline\\\">The world of life</p> <p>The origin of life is made by the activities of the world. Once anything appears in the world of phenomenon, its keeps doing the things that make itself exist through its own activities. The important point is that what is inside the self has effects on the future as well as the present.</p> <p class=\\\"blue underline\\\">The essence of destiny</p> <p>There are a lot of people in the human world who don't know exactly about destiny. Destiny is the thing which comes to exist in oneself due to what one saw, heard, and how one acted. As long as there is no Enlightenment, one is always controlled by Karma in oneself. We call this thing destiny.</p> <p class=\\\"blue underline\\\">Requirements for happiness</p> <p>Everyone wants happiness. But the human world doesn't yet know how happiness exists or what makes happiness. Someone who wants to be happy must learn how they can make happiness exist in themselves and must know what they can obtain happiness through. Happiness is made by what is in oneself. A happy life is the life in which you don't have loneliness, hunger and worry.</p> <p class=\\\"blue underline\\\">The secrets of the God in which the human world believes</p> <p>God is the consciousness which is made through the activities of the living. This consciousness is made through the separation of spirit and body. The consciousness which has problems stays in the dimension of the human world. The cases where it contacts with human beings occur due to what the consciousness has.</p> <p class=\\\"blue underline\\\">The importance of the truth</p> <p>The truth is the meaning which what is has, or the things in phenomena which appear through what is. The truth can't be observed from anywhere and exists through any event. The reason why the human world doesn't have any interest in the truth is that the teaching of the truth is very insufficient. The truth must be given the most important place in human life. This is because in the truth there is the way which makes things of the world exist.</p> <p class=\\\"blue underline\\\">What is life ?</p> <p>In the human world, most people don't know exactly why they live. This fact is the evidence that no one in the human world is aware of the importance of life. Life is the way which makes the self exist through what comes to exist inside the self.</p> <p class=\\\"blue underline\\\">The secret of eternal life</p> <p>In the human world, the words, 'eternal life' have come down from the past. However, it isn't easy for people to know the way to eternal life. In order to live eternally, first of all, one must do what makes eternal life happen to oneself through one's own activities. If not, eternal life won't happen to anybody. The explanation of how people can live eternally will be given.</p> <p class=\\\"blue underline\\\">The answer on creationism and evolutionism</p> <p>In the human world, there has been much debate over whether creationism or evolutionism is more superior for a long time. But this has only been a waste of time. The answer is made according to which side one starts from. Creation and evolution are connected to each other as a correlative concept. So, seen from the side of creation the answer comes through evolution and seen from the side of evolution the answer comes through creation. Therefore, in order to get the answer we must look at both creation and evolution on the same level.</p> <p class=\\\"blue underline\\\">Changing period</p> <p>Some people in the human world have wondered how mankind has been able to exist for a long time and various claims on this have been put forward, Most of them believe the word that everything is determined by God. However, the world changes and exists in a single principle. Everything in the world comes to exist through the phenomena of repetition. The phenomenon of repetition has made mankind exist for a long time. Just as the hour hand of a clock completes a cycle every 12 hours, the world is also repeating within a certain cycle. The changing period means what exists in the process which is necessary to transfer from one mankind to another.</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<h2>Cause and Effect of Karma</h2> <p>There is a word \\\"Karma\\\", passed on from the past, but nowadays it is rare to find someone who knows correctly what Karma is.

The Karma is made by things that happened to you. Then how can things that happened to you make this Karma ? it is important to understand that.

Human beings save everything what they did in their consciousness. This consciousness works as a spirit and when the spirit comes to meet death it remains independent by separating from the body. When this consciousness which was in the spirit disappears it will be reborn as life soon. But because the consciousness disappeared it does not mean things what happened in the past will disappear. Even if the consciousness disappeared, everything which happened to you will be latent in that. So these complex things which are latent in you will continuously cause reaction. The habit of Karma is trying to keep repeatedly things that happened to you forever, and that is Karma. There are two meanings which allow everything to exist in the world. The world exists by these two meanings. The first one is reincarnation.</p> <p>Reincarnation means that everything is repeated. Something which exists continuously causes the phenomenon of repetition, past present and future are spinning endlessly. So our life exists by this law and every creature is repeatedly being born and dying by the law of cause and effect. If something was born in the world but does not disappear by itself but tries to keep itself to exist. Something that happened to you has same meaning. So if something is saved in your consciousness it does not disappear but it continuously acts by receiving the influence of it. According to what happened to you, present and future life will be different. So things in yourself which will stay forever will be different, that's why to make a relationship is something that people must be very careful of. When a person makes a relationship with a bad thing that will produce a bad thing but when a person makes a relationship with a good thing that will produce a good thing. This is also the Law of Cause and Effect. Karma will exist in you by the cause and effect. As long as this Karma exists a human cannot be able to be free from the control of this Karma.</p> <p>If someone has a big Karma and if the person tries to live good life and to do good things rather than not becoming a good self will ruin others as well. And by doing things to become a good self will always make oneself distressed. Because there should be a good source in yourself but if there is not that good source it is rare to occur good things in you. At this point only Enlightenment can influence you. Without Enlightenment you cannot disobey the direction of Karma which is in you. We can see phenomenon like this from our surroundings easily and it is very important for the life of human being. Therefore nobody can get out of these phenomenon without Enlightenment. The law of nature is strict. In mathematics two plus two cannot be one or five, things which exist are not changeable in truth as well as mathematics it never changes. That is why people say that the most important thing for living all our period of life is Enlightenment.</p> <p>If someone does a good thing and makes a good result of 60% but makes a mistake of 40% with ignorance while the person was not aware, in this situation the person can control emotions and wrong temper and can fix something which is wrong if the person tries. But if someone makes Karma which is the result of ignorance by making mistake of 60 % but good Karma of 40% in this situation it is very hard to do a good thing because the power of big Karma interferes rather than good self when the person is doing something. The reason why there are many problems that appear in our society is because the society doesn't accept about how Karma is made by things what happened to someone in the past. How does Karma appear ?</p> <p>Karma appears by things in you. How is Karma made ? Karma is made by words and actions, Karma can be made by actions and words. What kind of Karma is made by words. When someone says things that the person doesn't know then that will be the Karma. Telling lies is something that ruins oneself and others too. This is Karma which is made by words. That is why disciples who were taught rightly by Buddha wrote at the beginning of the script \\\"I heard like this\\\"</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<p>Throughout their lives, people have a lot of interest in themselves. Amongst the interest which they have in themselves, the thing which they are most interested in is their destiny.</p> <p>In human society the saying, 'Once a destiny has been decided it cannot be changed' has been handed down. However, it still hasn't been explained properly how a destiny is made or what kind of effect destiny has on people. So it's a fact that people don't have a correct understanding of destiny.</p> <p>What, in fact, is destiny?</p> <p>How is destiny made?</p> <p>How can we change our destiny?</p> <p>When we look at and learn about what is in the world, the thing which we are most fearful of is Karma. The more we understand this Karma, about how great a cause it carries, the more fearful we become. This is because this Karma is the source which causes the destiny of the human world to exist.</p> <p>By accepting, without realising it, thousands, tens of thousands, of things which have happened to you and which you have done, you make Karma. This Karma makes the destiny which controls you.</p> <p>No matter how much we try to make people with big Karma do something good, it is impossible. This is because the consciousness of a human is influenced by the Karma which exists inside him.</p> <p>The nature of a sip of water changes depending on who drinks it. If a venomous snake drinks it, it becomes poison. If a deer drinks it, it becomes antlers. If you give a snake water and tell it to make antlers, it is impossible.</p> <p>All substances and forms of life which exist in the world, all carry their own individual Karma. For example, a piece of metal or a plant, they all have their karma individually. Because of this fact, they are maintaining their own unique selves.</p> <p>Karma means that what happened to you accumulates inside you. It appears from inside you when it becomes active, even though you don't want it to.</p> <p>Among Karma, the thing we have to be most careful of is attachment. Whatever you do, it makes Karma inside you. If in this way you come to have attachment to material things or attachment to people, that will be something which makes big Karma for you.</p> <p>Next is grudge. Among Karma, the biggest Karma is grudge.</p> <p>If people have big attachment or grudge they can't re-incarnate. In serious cases, they might fall into a terrible situation where they abandon being born as a human.</p> <p>Karma occurs due to your behaviour. Especially, if you make karma through attachment or grudge it is the same thing as tying yourself with your hands. It means that you can't move yourself on your own and make yourself be fixed to the place where you have once lived.</p> <p>The world exists according to the single formula. It means that all the world's phenomena exist according to the single principle. This principle means that problems of what happens make results according what happens. The world has already existed for thousands of billions of years through the principle, and it will also exist through this principle in the future as well. This principle exists through the activities of what is.<br/>Now let's examine how a human soul is made and what activities it performs when it is born again, while observing the process in which vegetation produces seed.</p> <p>They process in which plant life or people produce their result is exactly the same. In other words, the fact that they accept the single principle is the same. For plant life, the ground is called its foundation and the seed its basic nature. This basic nature and foundation must be sound for it to bear good fruit. Any body could confirm this as an undeniable fact if they were to try farming.</p> <p>The seed(basic nature) performs the activities of life and is influenced according to whether the ground(foundation) is good or bad, fertile or infertile. And according to the ground's environment, the seed itself can perish or become better.</p> <p>It's a universal fact that an individual life forms can obtain a good fruit or lose it according to its foundation and environment.</p> <p>The human soul is also exactly the same as this. Humans don't bear fruit, they make the consciousness which is inside them. In other words, they bear their soul. And when this soul dies it is revived and appears as life again.<br/>At the essence of this soul lie the things which were in ones life, just as they are. And when this soul is revived the nature inside one or what has happened to him again continues its activities.</p> <p>A soul makes itself be revived by combining with a special relationship which exists in its foundation and repeats the same activities as had made itself exist.</p> <p>Therefore, the essence of destiny is the activity which has existed in ones basic nature when he is revived through the connection between his basic nature and a special relationship in his foundation. This activity in his basic nature is made by what has happened to him and becomes the origin of all the activities of consciousness which makes him accept, reject, judge, or think of things.</p> <p>When people do something wrong once, why do they continue to make that mistake? The thing which is put into their consciousness once, would try to make them repeat the same thing. So, if they fall into a mistake once, the strength of that mistake will force them to do wrong things. Like this, the influence of what is inside you brings forth the result which makes your basic nature weak or strong. In this way, the basic nature of your destiny is decided. The essence of destiny is determined by what exists inside you.</p> <p>Because of the above fact, we should explain to people who always fail and do something wrong about this principle and enlighten them about it, and make them realise wrong things which come out of themselves. If they notice the fact once, they can lead themselves to the right direction, see what is, and try to follow good people's destiny by not accepting wrong things and taking them into practice. If things change in that way their destiny will change and become better.</p> <p>Destiny is made by the things inside each individual's relationships. This destiny controls each individual's life and, furthermore, it can control society and further still, it can control a nation.</p> <p>According to whose thoughts become powerful, the destiny of a society or a country can be different.<br/>If people with bad destinies run a country, the country will be ruined, and if those kinds of people become influential on a society, that society will have more and more difficulties. When someone with a bad destiny tries to live they always make themselves have difficulties.</p> <p>Then, when a person is born with a bad destiny, can't they help living desperately? Not necessarily.<br/>With the numbers in mathematics, you can make an enormous amount of problems. In the same way you can make many problems with what is in the world.</p> <p>In math, 5+5=10 and 5+12=17. Because the questions of 5+5 and 5+12 are different, we know that the answers are also different. Once we can understand this, people can change their problems by making problems which they need and changed answers can come out of the changed problems.</p> <p>How can we change destiny?</p> <p>First, we have to know how to make problems. Just like you have to know how to pose problems in mathematics. Then, how are these problems made? First you have to know the numbers and then you have to understand the formula.</p> <p>In mathematics, the problem is the source of the answer.</p> <p>In the world, the whole of the world of phenomena exists according to the matters concerned in what is.<br/>In the world of phenomena we can see good things and bad things and good things and bad things happen according to a problem.</p> <p>When it comes to changing ones consciousness, once someone knows what is and comes to realize what is in their own consciousness, anyone can change themselves easily.</p> <p>Therefore, no matter how much of a bad destiny someone has if they understand correctly what is, they won't do things depending on their thought, but what is. If so, they can be free from their bad destiny. If they come to fully understand about their destiny and realise, \\\"Doing this isn't right. If I do this I'll be harmed\\\", they don't want to do anything to harm themselves.</p> <p>Changing one's destiny is possible by knowing exactly what is, and through being Enlightened about what is. Through Enlightenment one doesn't accept one's destiny and one makes a new destiny.</p> <p>Destiny can be changed by anyone, easily. However without Enlightenment and without being able to recognise what is, changing ones destiny is impossible.</p> <p>No matter how much somebody is eager to change their thoughts, if they don't understand properly what is and they just go around relying on their own thoughts they can never change their thoughts.</p> <p>In this way, people with a good destiny live a good life and through that life they make a good destiny inside themselves and can live endless happy lives in the future, but we have to understand the fact that people with a bad destiny, through mistakes in their life, can even destroy their basic nature and foundation whose good parts are less at that.</p> <p>Everything in the world is decided according to the principle of relationship. The relationship inside you, the relationship arises when you meet the world, etc. A good relationship or a bad relationship remains dormant in the consciousness at the same time and according to the activities of these clandestine things in the consciousness, you make yourself ignorant, you make yourself fail, you make yourself enlightened, you make yourself an outstanding man or you make yourself a successful man.</p> <p>Anyone can change their destiny if they know the truth of the phenomena which exist.</p> <p>Why should we live?</p> <p>The purpose of our living is that the very life is the source that makes us exist. Because we are doing the things that will make us exist in the future through this life, through this life we live to the base of destiny which will influence endless future lives as well as the present life</p> <p>Then, how is this base made? It's made according to our judgement, actions, and effort.</p> <p>The things inside us themselves become the source of our consciousness. And this source of the consciousness exerts an influence on us through endlessly.</p> <p>Destiny is the fact that what has happened to oneself accumulates in oneself again and again and becomes karma and the karma controls you.</p> <p>When one substance joins with another substance, a new nature appears. When you put something inside yourself through a certain relationship that nature which has entered you appears whenever you act. This nature inside you will make all kinds of phenomena.</p> <p>Why do some people fail and others succeed, even though they do the same thing? It is because the destiny that they have is different.</p> <p>If the destiny is different, how is it different? The things which people have inside them from the past, are different in each individual. Because the things which exist inside them are different, their thought, judgement, choice, and behaviour are all different.</p> <p>When someone does something, if they have lots of Karma their judgement isn't correct, they don't have much concern about the choices they take, and their behaviour isn't obvious. That's why they always fail. However, people with small Karma do things very well because they think highly of what is.</p> <p>During our lives, when we do something and it doesn't work out, the question of why it doesn't work out demands the most immediate attention. However most people don't understand this matter well and don't consider this matter to be important as well.</p> <p>As matter of fact, the thoughts of humans aren't much different. And because we learn similar things through education, the more alike our thinking becomes. However, if we go to Europe or Japan who live well and meet people there we shall find the fact that they aren't more handsome or beautiful, speak much better, and have behaviour than us.</p> <p>However, because there hasn't existed a proper teaching in our society that the way of thinking of our societies people has been developed in a dark way. Especially, the way of thinking in Confucianism has been seen uniquely in our society. In the teaching of Confucianism, there are no problems only answers.</p> <p>Sam-Kang and O-Ryun. \\\"The lieges should be loyal to the King.\\\" \\\"Children should be dutiful to ones parents.\\\" \\\"There should be faith between friends.\\\" These are words we all need. However, there aren't any important elements. It means that there aren't any problems. There isn't the way how those who have such qualities can be made but answers are only enumerated. In the end, the most essential solutions given in Confucian teaching have, in actuality, caused people to do only useless things. If you take this and examine history, you will be able to see many wrong things.</p> <p>Those who have only answers, are aware of nothing but giving orders. People who receive that kind of education think that everything will be fine if the orders only are given. So it's only giving the instruction, 'Go and make the result'. But when a more intelligent man hears it he agonizes and thinks, \\\"I was told to make the result but since there isn't the way we can make it, where can I go and get the result, can't I?. And finally he reports that it is impossible to get the result within the time limit. But the person who gave the order will say \\\"This is a bad man who disobeys and defies the command.\\\" He was given disadvantage or was killed in the end.</p> <p>We can confirm this kind of thing a lot in history. If weak people looked at this kind of thing once they felt very fearful of and couldn't disobey it and while trembling, far from defying it, didn't hesitate to do anything in order to remain alive. After all, when we observe the fact that the process of this land of education has become the cause for so many good people to be killed and for society to become dark, it cannot help making our skin crawl. The influence of this kind of education and thought still exists with us now.</p> <p>When we start a movement which is needed in a society, we first have to establish its purpose. It means that we definitely have to show problems. Secondly, we have to have the solutions to fulfill the purpose. Thirdly, a basic law i.e. a method of construction for a design drawing, must be presented. We should have a guide as to why we should have this movement and how the result is achieved. Fourthly, the people should be chosen. We have to have people who are able to run the movement. Suppose we started a movement for society in the situation where we are without these important points, it would just be a useless waste of effort.</p> <p>We have had a citizen's movement called 'New Community Movement' for a long time, but it couldn't fulfill these 4 points properly. Because the purpose wasn't first made clear, the problems which were taught to people weren't given in. Therefore, the solutions for the problems weren't needed. Accordingly, because there was no guide which would fulfill the solution the important teaching was left out. And the people who taught the guide and who could run the movement weren't decided. So in practice, when the Korean New Community Movement is compared to the enormous cost to the country of investment and spending, it has only achieved quite worthless things.</p> <p>The fact that roads were paved with cement and farm roads were widened wasn't enough. Because there was someone who provided money and bought cement and there were people who provided land, roads have been extended and widened, but those things weren't made by hanging New Community banners. Those things were achieved by money and effort. The government spent on maintaining the banners of the New Community Movement more money and man power than on making roads and it's a fact that in the end the New Community Movement hasn't been any help to in providing realistic work for solving the people's social or spiritual problems. This sort of thing makes society wrong.</p> <p>Confucian ideas. Teaching that have answers but no problems, in the end, makes this kind of reality.<br/>Suppose there is a situation where we are not enlightened and, furthermore, we don't have any interest in what is, we wouldn't think that the problems were important. When we get to know why we don't think that what is, is important, we see that it's because there is Karma. We have to remember that this kind of reality occurs because of the influence of Karma.</p> <p>What moves your thought? This is because your thought exists in the situation where what is inside you continuously acts inside you and exerts an influence. This thought can make you a person who thinks that what is, is important and it can make you a person who doesn't think that what is, is important. This fact makes the very destiny.</p> <p>The cause of goodness, badness, fortune, and misfortune lies in what is. It wouldn't be a difficult thing for us to escape from this dangerous reality and create a hopeful country in the future. It would be possible through solving the problems that we have properly even one by one. From the moment we solve them, the country's destiny changes, society's destiny changes and our destiny changes. But because most people ignore what is and don't think that the problems we have are important it's hard to do the things which make the country's destiny good.</p> <p>What practical use is wisdom in this country* ? It is common things that people are standing by with a bag of money in front of a person in power but people around the enlightened being turn away from him.<br/>We cannot get an answer without a problem. This is because the problem is the source of the answer.<br/>Suppose a situation simply had an answer and we didn't have a problem it would be very dangerous. This is because an answer without a problem cannot exist. Answers without problems always make us do useless things. So there is not need to listen to what people say if they don't have problems.</p> <p>The teaching that what kind of influence a certain thing has on us, is the best teaching.</p> <p>In the world, certain problems can be made by humans. Good problems make good answers. But in today's society there aren't any people who want to make good problems.</p> <p>In the end as a consequence of solutions without problems people will be forced to continue to suffer great pain in the future and I want to point out that this is the cause which makes miserable things that make people live their lives in darkness.</p> <p>Our society has become the nation of degree certificates and become the country where competition for entering universities is the most extreme. A Doctorate or a degree is a short cut to success, the way to make yourself live richly in the harsh realities, so people tried to study with all their might to get degrees. Although they were made to study, the importance of the problems has not been taught properly, so, in the end, people who can't see or know about problems live like a blind man.</p> <p>If you look at what is, the answer is there. But people don't want to know this. People always see things through their thinking and try to get the result. Because people don't try to get the answer after finding the problem, and instead look to heaven for a miracle or hope that someone will come and solve things, our society today has become gloomy.</p> <p>Because the mass media keep announcing that the credit rating is rising and that there are prospects that the economy will soon recover. It's like small comfort for foolish minds. An important thing is that no problems are visible. The fact has made the circumstances where we can't help avoiding a big calamity. Nonexistence of problems has made everything ambiguous.</p> <p>They say that they have made new jobs but if the people don't work very hard, it can't be of much hope for the country. The people become the basis of the nation. When the people work hard with a wholesome way of thinking the country goes well.</p> <p>The government's 'Movement of Second Founding of Nation' is demolishing run down tumbledown houses and build new ones. However, as long as the people who are doing this important work don't establish the purpose, plan, guide and people to manage the movement but hold the event only shouting slogans with banners hung, I can't help worrying that they will once again put our society into confusion and uncertainty and that it will be dangerous and a waste of financial resources.</p> <p>How can a social problem be solved? If we already have the number 5 and the answer 77, in the problem, 5 + X = 77, in order to get the answer 77, we should find the solution of adding 72.</p> <p>When we do something we should research and investigate through what problems can fulfill the purpose of it. However, in our society we hasn't reached the stage yet. If we make the answer but ignore the problem, how can we be solving it? When we demand an answer, we should look for problems which are correct for the society's environment, but in our society, it's something we aren't able to do.</p> <p>People say this kind of thing. \\\"You think you are so good, why don't you try and fix it.\\\" But that sort of thing is impossible. When you want to change something you need power. Unless all the people in the world try to make the world better respectively, it cannot be sure when the good world will come. If we don't try and if we don't act to get something good, we can't promise when the good thing will exist in the world.</p> <p>The thing that we have to consider important while we are alive in the world, is how we carry out the tasks given to us.</p> <p>Not only individual destiny but also society's and the nation's destiny are all made according to the relationships between of what is, in the society or country. The basis of society is people and also the basis of the country is the people of that society.</p> <p>We shouldn't forget that when we do something wrong, it not only damages ourselves but also causes big damage to society and the nation and further still the world.</p> <p>I said that destiny and consciousness are made from what is. And once something comes to exist inside you, it continues its activities. Society makes many people who have wrong thought appear through the wrong things that the society does. And those people continue to act with the wrong thought.</p> <p>What is the cause of this? This is decided by what is inside people. Even if in a past life you chose wrong things, and you have come to have the wrong kind of destiny, if you can really understand and be enlightened about this destiny in the present life, you can make your good destiny in never ending future lives. From that point of view, it will be a very important opportunity to understand about our destiny properly.</p> <p>*Talking about His home country South Korea.</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<p>Any human being should take an interest in what you are living for. The biggest problem nowadays in the world of human beings, which can be seen, is that most human beings do not try to know why they are living and what they should have to live for in their lives. We should see this is the result that human beings have abandoned themselves by greed and ignorance for a long time. Our life and the result of our life that we wish for is being ignored by darkness and unhappiness.</p> <p>Is life really the question which nobody can know ? Some people say that life is a never ending task and some people say that life is the secret which only god knows. We do not understand the fact why do we have to live by forgetting the pleasure of life which is in ourselves and why do we have to live our life by throwing away the value of life. We should understand the tremendous crisis of the world of human beings from the deteriorating or loss of the value of view of life and we should feel fear of the fact that these things prevail in our surroundings already. As long as religions do not know what life is and universities are the authorities of promoting position it is bound to be difficult for anyone to teach the truth of life and people who have already abandoned themselves will not want things in truth to be revealed.</p> <p>The duty of his era is how do we know about life and to choose what we have to live for. The most important thing for you to consider is to love yourself and to create a good self from you. The reason why I am talking about these things is because there is a principle in the world and all the answers are in the principle. Life is the whole process which exists from birth to death and we have the result in us through what happened in ourselves. When we know life we can see the real value of life and when we know life the real love can come out of ourselves. Unless the world of human beings cannot open their eyes to life the value of life will disappear forever. When your life cannot bless yourself the life is not yours anymore.</p> <p>The blessing for human beings is the ability that human beings can have and the fact that they cannot use their ability that they have for themselves means they lost themselves by ignorance. Now we should check about this problem. We should know what we know and what we are doing. All truth is appearing through the result. When the question is wrong the result comes out wrong and only someone who understands the question can make a good result.</p> <p>The most important problem that the world of human beings should know is how to accept our life and how to serve ourselves. The reason why Enlightenment has been emphasized in the world of human beings is that we have this kind of question in ourselves. The reason why we cannot perceive \\\"what is\\\" even though we see it is because we could not open our eyes to the truth and we have not given a good teaching to ourselves. When falsehood becomes a good virtue and the weapon of solving all the problems nobody will be able to protect the destruction of the world of human beings.</p> <p>Enlightenment is opening eyes to \\\"what is\\\" and the way to accept blessing and becoming further away from evil. In order to obtain Enlightenment in our world we need to understand life and we have to have a wish. If there is anyone who is willing to learn about life and to reveal the value of life to people then that will bring a bigger blessing than anything else.</p> <p>Anyone who has courage come here ! As long as your life does not change then problems in you will not change forever and your life will never change. In order for the world of human beings to solve ignorance we have to learn things in life and when we have made ourselves open our eyes to see ourselves we can eventually keep ourselves from greed and falsehood. Life means the process from birth to death and the teaching of life will become the best teaching for ourselves.</p> <p>The reason why the teaching of life is not passed down until now is because nobody could reveal the truth in the world because of the group of evils and also the teaching has disappeared which was passing down by the deterioration of life. Once again knowing life will make you obtain never-ending blessing for yourself and living without knowing life will become the biggest ignorance that you have ignored yourself. Things of the world can make existing things disappear and nonexistent things to appear by connection.</p> <p>Life is an opportunity to choose which has been given to you and your life and your future can change through things in life. No matter what anyone says if you live your life without knowing life then you will deceive yourself.</p> <p>What is life?</p> <p>Life is precious to anyone. However, ultimately few people lead their life with the correct understanding of life. Why do people live in the state of being unaware of life? It is because there hasn't been anyone who teaches about life or anyone who wants to learn about it either in this period.</p> <p>Life can make anything happen to you. What exists in life produces your endless future. That is to say, life is the way to eternal you. Through your life, you can be born as the best human who you want or as the worst human who you never want. Seen from all these facts, there is nothing more important than knowing life in terms of the survival of a human being. In other words, life without understanding itself is the same thing as is abandoned.</p> <p>Then, when it comes to saving you what is the most significant object to be saved? It is you yourself. You can find the same words in the bible. &ldquo;Nobody can reach the heaven through anyone else rather than the self.&rdquo; It was the explanation of Jesus that what exist in you would lead you to the heaven.</p> <p>Consciousness derives from what exists inside you and it comes from specific cause and effect, the karma or the virtue you have built. For example, there was a TV show that someone had made a big fortune by growing up medicinal herbs such as a wild ginseng and so forth in the mountain where the herbs doesn't grow naturally. It was possible because he studied about what exists, especially about the methods of cultivation and finally became to have the full understandings of them. His knowledge and ability made it possible for him to cultivate the herbs.<br/>Nobody can guarantee that trees not taken care of will bear good fruits. Expecting good results of life while you are living without being aware of the meaning of life is the same as waiting for a good harvest from trees you have never looked after. Being unaware of how to live is the exactly same thing as doing something very bad to you.</p> <p>Unstable society is up to people&rsquo;s life filled with ignorance. If you realize that what you do will exist inside of you as well as affect you endlessly you cannot take any reckless actions. Realistically, since you don't realise it, you are to take any kinds of careless actions. This makes you change for the worse and causes wrong things in the world as well. Living in the state of being unaware that what results things you have will create and what effects they will have on you, brings about nothing but mistakes.</p> <p>In the meantime, it is not so easy to know life according to people. It is because people have the uniqueness of their own. There is a feature that drives you and on the basis of the feature, you see, react, understand, and accept an object. It is the very origin of destiny. Since people have different origins of destiny respectively, they have different understandings of the same object.</p> <p>Then, how is the origin of destiny created? Just as a physical body grows up by food, especially by the energy of the food, consciousness is brought up by what has existed in the lord of the consciousness. What you hear, see, and experience accumulates over and over again inside you to make the growth of spirit. If something wrong is involved in this process the consciousness which is wrong will be made and subsequently a bad origin of the consciousness will be formed. So is a good origin of the consciousness. This kind of relationship can be observed in nature. Conclusively, it can be explained that it appears by the formula, the law, the truth, the promise, etc.<br/>By the way, what is the biggest reason why people don't know these precious things? It is because of falsehood. This unawareness indicates that falsehood has covered truth over.</p> <p>A famous Chinese scholar said in the past. &ldquo;If I am enlightened about Do (the way of the world) in the morning it doesn't matter whether or not I die in the evening.&rdquo; What is Do, then? Do (the way of the world) means the law of cause and effect of how what exists in the world appears and changes. It is as important to be enlightened to perceive what exists as it is and how it could come into being as he said that he could die in the evening only if he had become aware of what exists.</p> <p>Knowing life is the way to understand the world. If you recognize life correctly you can understand the world correctly. Knowing the world is the same as obtaining the world. In the same way, knowing life is the way to gain oneself. That is to say, knowing life is the way to peace, happiness, eternal life, resurrection and the heaven. Teaching about life has as important meaning as that.</p> <p>Neglecting life or having no regard for it is giving up your whole future. In the state of abandoning future, how can you want to be happy and live well? If a person made a big fortune by doing something wrong with ignorant thoughts the fortune would give you a lot of troubles. Due to the fortune, all sorts of disputes and unhappiness can appear endlessly. Anyone including you can meet these happenings in case that you bear bad thoughts from the fear of hunger in a short run without observing what exists.</p> <p>Although life is really hard and difficult why should you bear and overcome it? It is because the way of your whole future is formulated during the process of life. If you commit suicide because of the difficulties of life there is no future. Even though you are born again you will become much weaker and repeat the same things. These are typical examples you experience due to ignorance of life.</p> <p>Crops grow up under the influences of ground and environment and as a result, bear fruits. So does a soul. So does consciousness. Consciousness can be active vivaciously or make the better self by knowledge, Enlightenment, and the influence of environment. And although it cannot be active very much, unless it does such a wrong thing that harm itself it might become able to change for the better naturally.</p> <p>If a certain amount of oil is poured into the ground where crops grow up very well the ground will burn out and after all have terrible effects on the crops. If you accept things or relationships which may damage or affect badly you during a certain process, as crops do, consciousness can be withered or ruined.</p> <p>Learning the way of life, i.e. how you lead your life is the project of your life. Unless someone teaches you how to achieve it you should do it for yourself. However, people don't even try to recognise what the project is like and to carry it out. This is the biggest problem people in this era have.</p> <p>In any circumstances, you must not look to any particular objects for the better change in you or to some good effects happening to you. If you could obtain unexpected and incomprehensible profits by serving gods, the happening will cause much bigger loss. It is because offering nothing but prayer will prevent you from learning what you have to do and enlightening yourself about what exists and finally only give you ignorance. The ignorance will perish you. It is irrational to suppose that only objects like gods can make people change for the better or for the worse. It is ultimately rare in human history that gods help people be born again, go to the heaven, and enlighten themselves. The evidences have never been acquired yet.</p> <p>What you must think the most important and must not forget is that what you do becomes the causes of all the results inside you. Also, you have to observe carefully what exist all the time and have to know what kinds of results your behaviour makes.</p> <p>To know life is to know everything. It couldn't be better if you know how you should live. You will be able to work hard and think about what isn't harmful to yourself. If so, you will live well.</p> <p>In the world like today approaching the end, it is considered natural for people to live with life neglected. Knowing life cannot only be blessing but also be agony to those whose willpower is weak.</p> <p>Attachment becomes obstacles in life or darkness in life or makes you ignorant. It doesn't mean that you should not love your children, siblings, and parents. You can love them but you must never have attachment to them. Then, what is attachment and what is love? Attachment makes you long for things unconditionally. Attachment originates from desire. Love starts with blessing. What makes things or people change for the better is blessing and what makes them change for the worse is attachment. People don't distinguish attachment from blessing. They misunderstand attachment as love, or love as attachment and take actions.</p> <p>The attachment makes, for example, you think your son &ldquo;MY&rdquo; son and your daughter &ldquo;MY&rdquo; daughter. You are not aware, however, that the attachment makes your children and siblings worse. Children are they, themselves and not you, yourself. If you have good thoughts and good will you should practice them first for yourself. And then you can teach them to your children. It is wrong that you don't teach your children in that way and only look to them to do what you want. If you teach them they will do what you want naturally. You only want them to do things without teaching them. It is the same as wanting them to do something impossible.</p> <p>The biggest love is teaching. Why do you send children to school? Don't you send them to school to make them be taught by other people about what you cannot teach for yourself ? Sending to school is love. Teaching children originates from the intention that you help them acquire blessing for themselves through learning.</p> <p>If you consider these things useless there will not be any hope in the world where you live. Hope is the very thing you make and grow up. It is really rare that what you have never made and grown up happens in your surroundings. In order to understand these things, you need Enlightenment and learning. Especially, what is considered the most important during the process of learning is life. If you don't know life it is certain that you can never learn love.</p> <p>Even though you don't study and learn at all in school, if you can learn about life properly you can live superbly. However much and high you have scholastic abilities, if you don't know about life how can you lead your life? Therefore, you must always think life precious and must hold the confidence that you lead your life well and make it more brilliant and bless it through endless future.</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<p>When people are asked what they want, almost all of them say in no time, \\\"We want happiness and peace.\\\" However few people know the way they can get happiness and peace. Though people don't know what happiness is and what peace is, it seems that they want happiness and peace just because their lives are tough. </p><h3>Peace</h3> <p>And how can we get happiness and peace? From old times, many teachings have been handed down in the world. Among them we hear the word 'truth' a lot and sometimes the word 'truth' can be expressed by different words in some cases. For example, 'Do'(Korean pronunciation), 'law' or 'promise' etc. have the same meaning as truth. When we give a definition of truth on law or 'Do' 's view, it can be explained that truth is way, the way to make the world exist. And 'way and virtue'(morality) means that right behaviour cultivates great 'virtue'. Right behaviour and life are exactly 'Do' and way as well. In other words, truth is the way, 'Do' is the way and law is the way to let any phenomena exist. Promise is also classified as the same meaning. In case we do not keep what we have to do, happiness and peace can not exist. Happiness and peace come to exist when the condition is completed.</p> <p>When we live the bright mind in the bright world, true peace comes to exist in our mind. When we do not have any unhappy things, when it is guaranteed that miserable things will not happen to us, the life can be maintained peacefully and we can always feel peace. Otherwise peace does not exist. When we keep our conscience in a righteous world, when we make our conscience stand right, peace will exist in ourselves. However these things have never been taught right in human society so far, people came to forget how to get peace and it became the object which exists in an ideal. People say that they want peace because life is tough and uneasy. However people are overlooking the fact that the peace can be obtained by their own efforts.</p> <h3>Happiness</h3> <p>What is happiness indeed? What is the law of happiness?</p> <p>Once we live without hunger, without loneliness and with bright mind; those kinds of minds exist, that is happiness. In order to live without hunger, loneliness and darkness, we ourselves should make those conditions.<br/>Then, how those conditions can be made?</p> <p>First, when we work hard, live frugally and put aside some money, the property will increase. As a result, hunger can be got rid of.</p> <p>Second, when we live diligently and frugally, we can get trust from others. If we work hard without deceiving others, we can get trust and come to make friends with good people. If we get acquainted with good friends, talk with them, depend on each other and share blessings, we can lead a life without loneliness.</p> <p>Honesty is the third condition. When we do not lie, our minds get bright.</p> <p>Therefore, being diligent, frugal and honest are just right way and law to get happiness.</p> <p>But there is a society where we can not get happiness no matter how diligently, frugally and honestly we may live. In the circumstance that truth and justice are ignored, those three conditions are not admissible in certain cases. In the society where truth and justice are ignored, even though we keep those three conditions, we can not feel happy easily. That is because that kind of society is dark. No matter how bright mind have we, it is difficult for us to see the light in a dark world. No matter how good sight we may have, once we are in a world which is pitch black, there is no difference between our vision and the blind's. On the contrary the blind feels less uncomfortable while living in such a dark world.</p> <h3>Reality</h3> <p>Peace and happiness can not be mere words any more which exist in an ideal. Peace and happiness are made just by ourselves. These two (peace and happiness) have to be accomplished by ourselves. Nobody can bring us peace and happiness except ourselves. And an Enlightenment is essential for us to get peace and happiness.</p> <p>Enlightenment is the most important thing in human life and for the Enlightenment a lot of people have been playing all kinds of foolish things. But we will never know even where the way to Enlightenment is unless we are awakened to the truth. In other words, we don't know which things are on which way. If we don't know what makes things exist, it is difficult to achieve our expecting goals.</p> <p>The importance of life and the things in truth are what we always explain through what is. Once we know the things in truth, we ourselves can lead a life which we want. This is a very crucial point.</p> <p>Today, we can see that lots of people debate on certain matters with the greatest enthusiasm on media. But listening to the discussion, we cannot help feeling frustrated. Recently the debate on the subject of \\\"Lay-off, How can we solve the problem?\\\" was on TV.</p> <p>Each one of the professors of economics expressed his ideas hard but listening to them carefully, we found out that actually they were talking about what they themselves didn't know. They were insisting on their opinions like this. \\\" We should restructure\\\" or \\\"we should not\\\".</p> <p>Now, the urgent thing to be done in our society is not the discussion about lay-off but the producing social environment in which everyone who wants to work can do. It is important to build up the social environment in which anyone who is healthy and able to work can work easily. And we can say that today's system or conception - most people are tied up in the company which is run by conglomerates, chaebol*, and people are living on it - is really wrong.<br/>A nation can not take all the individual's place for his/her life.</p> <p>A ruler can not take all the individual's place for his/her life and we can not have a ruler undertake all the rights to live of over 40 million people. Then, we should demand our right openly. \\\"Make the society where we can have jobs.\\\" This is an important thing. Actually, lay-off and restructuring are less important.</p> <p>How can we make a profit producing goods when wage is fairly high. What can we do paying people who are unnecessary and making unprofitable goods? So far in this countries government* have been demanding that the conglomerates do that. Therefore the government is cowed by the chaebol. This phenomenon results in the a collusion between big companies and government and insolvent operation. It seems that bad finance of this country is much more than we thought. It might be over hundreds of trillion Won.</p> <h3>Affection and Love</h3> <p>Why this phenomenon happens? It's because everything is controlled and meddled by only one person. I believe that because all our happiness is swayed by ruling classes, there is no happy people essentially in this country. In other words, when we get temporal comfort and come to have lots of material for a while and we made our ideal come true, we think that we are happy for the time being. But that is not true happiness.</p> <p>Here is an example. When a passer-by gives a beggar 5000 Won for food, is this love? No, it isn't. This is pity and sympathy. But people often call this love. This is actually a wrong idea. Love must be blessing.<br/>Treating a beggar to food with 5000 Won can not become love. It is giving pity or sympathy. As it is mentioned before, gaining temporal satisfaction, it can not be happiness.</p> <h3>Reality in Education</h3> <p>Why do we need education? The studies of technology field such as engineering are needed to develop our daily life and other studies mostly are needed to know what is right and what is wrong, which is the biggest purpose in our life, and cultivate our personality. The education to make us know what is right and wrong is needed for us to be awakened to the things in the world. But if the world is dark and justice is gone, the education can not teach people what is right and wrong.<br/>Actually, since 1970 there has been a strange trend in our society.</p> <p>Somebody told that this was reported as a topic in other countries. \\\"Korean high school students go to school at 5 a.m. and come back home at 10 p.m. carrying their bags in order to prepare college entrance exam. This kind of country exists in the world.\\\"</p> <p>What is the reason to make sensitive young men stay at school? At school, even though the students have to stay at school for over 15 hours, they are never taught the studies for the accomplishment of their personality and forced to memorize the writings of the textbooks. And the questions in the tests are so tricky that they can not be solved easily. As a result, the publication of commentary comes to be necessary and students are forced to memorize its contents again.</p> <p>Making up the right social environment will contribute to our gaining happiness and peace. As it was mentioned before, when social environment makes it possible to provide people with jobs, even people who are not specially outstanding can settle down in their jobs. And sometimes they find themselves worth living more and more by accepting good teachings and frugal life. This is the way people can achieve happiness they want.</p> <p>They that know nothing fear nothing</p> <p>In our country, this phenomenon seems to be so common that wrong ideas and knowledge cause bad results. When we listen to the most intellectual people, they are playing upon words.</p> <p>When we go to farmers and ask them how to do farming, they give us realistic answers. \\\"This seed has certain kind of nature. So if we put it in the warehouse for freezing and lower the temperature, it sleeps feeling that winter has come. And then, if we take it out and plant it in the greenhouse in the winter, it buds feeling that the spring has come since it already wintered. \\\" That is correct.</p> <p>But the intellectuals are saying what does not fit in with the reality. Why this phenomenon happens? This is also due to the social environment. When we would like to know about a problem, first of all, we should look at 'what is'. And then we should find out precisely why the thing became like that. After that, the problem can be solved properly.</p> <p>It is dangerous to prescribe for a patient without examining him who went to see a doctor. First, diagnosis is needed and then prescription is to be followed. However, today in our society, the diagnosis of the problem is not made properly. Though doctors who diagnoses are not seen, fabulous opinion of prescription is full. People who say the right thing are denounced instead. All kinds of wrong opinions fabricated by wrong people make the right people be denounced in a morning and make them bad people finally. When a seriously ill patient is in hospital, the comfort words saying \\\"You will recover soon, Have courage, Be healthy and Get up\\\" can not make him healthy. To solve a problem, a reliable diagnosis is always needed and then an accurate prescription should be followed.<br/>Open your eyes on 'what is'</p> <p>The true purpose of education is to make people know what is and understand what is correctly. To know what is correctly, first we have to recognize that the right thing and the wrong one exist in what is. And when we come to know about what is and see what is, we call it Enlightenment. If the education can not make it possible for people's consciousness to see what is, the education is a failure.</p> <p>Today, the wrong education is responsible for our society getting into trouble under the structure of conglomerates, chaebol. Take today's social condition. People only from primary school are willing to work in a factory with low wages. People just completed the junior high school choose jobs as delivery men and vegetable sellers. And also they are willing to carry a handcart and do farming. But the problem is the people with high educational background. They want to use their brain but do not want physical labour. So conglomerates are the only means and purpose of their living.</p> <p>Why do we have to depend on others? Human beings are able to take care of and be responsible for themselves. Once the government keeps the society's justice, all the things can be solved by individuals. It is very pity that our society still can not do such things.<br/>'Everything comes to exist according to one meaning.'<br/>A 'meaning' is law, truth, promise and 'Do'(way). We should not ignore the meaning. It is the right thing for us to teach people to live abiding by the meaning by the education or teachings.</p> <p>It is true that Admiral Yi, Sun-Shin, General Eul Ji Mun Deok and people like that shielded our country when it was invaded by other countries. But we should not spend time just admiring them all the time. The important point is that we ourselves have to become such people and all the nation have to try to be an Admiral Yi, Sun-Shin and a General Eul Ji Mun Deok. \\\"Andrew Carnegie from America became the king of steel. In difficult circumstances, he became the king of steel in the world and came to have both honor and wealth.'' This is a good lesson. The important thing is that not just reading his biography and admiring him but making ourselves be a Carnegie.</p> <p>Education means to make all the young be a Carnegie and the most important purpose of education is to make all the people holding dream and courage brave commanders such as Admiral Yi, Sun-Shin and General Eul Ji Mun Deok. However, for the past decades, this has never happened in our society. And that is the problem.</p> <p>Nothing convinces me why these days deserts the right thing and takes the wrong one. The way we can lead our lives worthy of men is knowing what is right and wrong. We should be able to defend ourselves by avoiding what is wrong. Why should we try to avoid the wrong thing? That is because to defend ourselves. We should not have a feeble thought that we will rely on others while living.</p> <p>Today, our society is unsafe and the problem of this unsafety can not be solved easily. That is because social environment is not improved. If something is wrong, we should abandon the wrong one.</p> <p>Let's assume that you are gambling now. After playing the cards a few times, if it does not go well, then you should stop. It is the best way to give it up when you do not have any confidence. Even though you lost 9,000 Won* out of 10,000 Won, do not lose the rest of it, 1000 Won, trying to get back your loss. Leaving the gambling place, you can think that you earned 1,000 Won in gambling today and unless you quit right away, we will lose even the last 1,000 Won.</p> <p>If we think we are in the wrong place, we had better leave the place right now. If we think that there must be something wrong in our society, we should break from the structure. If we make sure that something is wrong, we should cut it off without hesitation. Today, our society is unable to make up its mind.</p> <p>This is the reason that our nation and society where a lot of people are living are quite a distance from happiness and peace. If we are awakened to what is, we ourselves are able to get out of the wrong place. This is the way to bring glory to our society and nation.</p> <p>* Tathagata talks about South Korea his home country.<br/> * The chaebol are the large, conglomerate family-controlled firms of South Korea characterized by strong ties with government agencies.<br/> * Won is the Korean Currency.</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<p>Dear Brothers,</p> <p>When I open my eyes I become exhausted.

There's paradise and hell in the mind because the mind has every way in it. The Truth is in this world and truths are in the minds of humans. All the phenomena which appears in this world are truths. Truth, in the mind which can see this truth, is filled with virtue. A person with good virtue always reaps the benefit, but someone who lacks virtue always meets with disaster as a result. Virtuous people always like goodness, but those who lack virtue always like bad things.</p> <p>The foundation of virtue is in the mind.<br/>The foundation of Truth is in this world.</p> <p>Consciousness is like an electric wave, it transmits and receives meaning. A seed has an 'eye'. The 'eye' is its consciousness. The consciousness was made from a background of earth, environment and past lives. All the past life of the seed appears again in the 'eye'. But if the conditions of the earth and the environment change, then the result will be different. The changed condition will be encoded in the plant. All the existence of a human being was made in the past. The consciousness appears the same as in the past</p> <h3>The World of Life</h3> <p>Nowadays there are many people who live around us and they all have different characters and lifestyles.<br/>In order to understand things in ourselves first we have to know about consciousness and the function of the human body, but there are many people who still do not easily understand things like this.</p> <p>Then let's study about what is consciousness and what we call the human body. Consciousness is an organ which expresses and decides your ideas and saves things like what you have seen, heard and learned. The human body is our body itself which is an organ that exists for the growth and activity of consciousness.</p> <p>The reason why everybody has different characters and hobbies is because things which are saved in our consciousness are different. If something goes into the consciousness it does not easily disappear even if it is a very small thing. It will affect your activity continuously.</p> <p>The basis of consciousness is made by things which were latent in you and these things exist by what happened to you.</p> <p>Therefore every activity is the way of existing yourself and everything exists through this activity in the world of life.</p> <p>When we make good things through knowing things that exist and through what is, consciousness accepts that. When we know wrong things and let wrong things exist, consciousness accepts the wrong things. These things which were accepted by our consciousness will affect the activity of consciousness.<br/>If you want a good life but cannot obtain it, the reason why is because of things what happened to you. We call these things in your consciousness which control you, karma. This karma is in you through things what happened to you.</p> <p>If this karma disappears in a living person then the person will reach the degree of nirvana and can be an Enlightened Being. Therefore anyone who knows this does not make mistakes easily. To say not to make mistakes means not to do something carelessly whatever situation exists.</p> <p>The reason why the world of human being wanted Enlightenment is to live with knowing these things. If there is Enlightenment people will see things as they exist and depend on things that exist rather than depending on their ideas.</p> <p>Consciousness of people is acting by things in the past which were recorded in themselves and the phenomenon which appears from this is different.</p> <p>Some people are not making mistakes but achieve success in their business and make a fortune even though they are not educated nor inherited anything. But other people are not like that even though they are well educated and inherited a good fortune. These facts exist by the effect of karma which runs down from past lives. These things are not changeable if you live without being enlightened about things in the world even if you study a lot.</p> <p>If you want to know about someone, first you have to see their basis and foundation. This is a phrase which has run down from the past. This means that if you want to make a friend with someone you have to see the person's life and behaviour.</p> <p>Life expresses things or accepts things of it's own through the activity of consciousness. Things what happened in this life will decide things that will happen after death, rebirth and future life. The reason why this is happening is that the activity of life is remaining in consciousness and the things that existed in consciousness will appear in activity of life. But there are many people who still do not want to believe these kind of things because they do not have good karma.</p> <p>People say things like \\\"If you die that is it, there is no world after death.\\\" Most of them deny things that they will have to experience.</p> <p>The world of after death is after the world of activity of life. The world of after death is the state of separation between consciousness and the human body which is the world of existence of consciousness.</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<p>Anyone can save themselves through Enlightenment.

There are many people who have wasted much time for enlightenment from ancient times. However, only one person was recorded to have completed enlightenment thousands of years ago. Such a thing is caused from the fact that the way to enlightenment has not been transmitted correctly in the human world.</p> <p>Then, why was it that such a good teaching was unable to be transmitted through people to the world?</p> <p>People are moved by consciousness and are active by consciousness. Therefore, people don&rsquo;t accept that which doesn&rsquo;t agree with their consciousness, they cannot see it properly and cannot transmit it properly.

However much we say 'I want to be enlightened, I want to be enlightened', Enlightenment cannot be accomplished in the situation of not accepting Truth and not understanding Truth.</p> <p>In order to achieve enlightenment it should be started by understanding things in Truth, and accepting Truth. This is difficult depending on people. Because things that happened in the past in oneself refuse such a thing.</p> <p>Shakyamuni left words that even Buddha could not save mankind if there was no 'cause and occasion'. So however much it is a good teaching, one without 'cause and occasion' cannot accept it. It means that good 'cause and occasion' hasn&rsquo;t been done in oneself, one doesn't have connection to good 'cause and occasion'.</p> <p>An enlightened being appeared in the past world, but people didn't come near to the enlightened being. This was because people were not able to recognise him. Therefore, the enlightened being tried to awaken people travelling on foot until he died at age 82 on the road. In those days, when people travelled on foot due to no benefit of civilisation, Buddha wouldn&rsquo;t had been treated well teaching people travelling on a palanquin. He travelled endlessly because there weren't people near to him all the time.</p> <p>Furthermore, most people who have tried to awaken others except Buddha, were killed by human beings. Socrates and Jesus Christ were condemned to capital punishment to die through the bestowal of poison or crucified on the cross. And Lao-tsu wandered about all his life long and died.</p> <p>And yet, why did the people of posterity said they are saints? It was because they didn&rsquo;t compromise with injustice and there was Truth in their teaching, the people of posterity were evaluated them as saints. However, it was many years after they died when they were treated as saints. They were people who lived not as a saints, but the most lonely life when they were alive.</p> <p>The reason that we made people who gave enlightenment to the human world feel loneliness and pain is that Truth wasn&rsquo;t transmitted properly, and was a phenomenon that occurred among the people who had a lack of understanding of Truth. We should be more concerned with such facts.</p> <p>Then let us find out how we can solve this problem so that we can live life with the aim of enlightenment, or save oneself through enlightenment.</p> <p>The reason that we want enlightenment, and we want to be near to the teaching of enlightenment is to open our eyes to the truth. Thus only the person who tries to know the truth can approach enlightenment.</p> <p>One common fact when enlightened beings appeared was that they saw the world of origin. No one can go into the world of origin with Karma. One comes to reach to the world of origin when Karma has all died out. The world of origin is the place where everything dies and is reborn. The people who saw the world of origin were only two among people who came to the world.</p> <p>One was Shakyamuni. Thus, the world that enlightened beings commonly come to see is the world of origin and the world of Salvation. As only the person who attains Salvation can come into the world of origin, the world of Salvation is the same as the world of origin.</p> <p>In plain language, becoming to gain complete truth is escaping from all things infected with falsehood. Otherwise, people with Karma never can attain 'Salvation'.</p> <p>Person who don't attain 'Salvation' are never able to be enlightened. Namely, the person can not achieve the last enlightenment; It is difficult to open eyes to the perfect truth.</p> <p>Enlightenment isn't a thing that you can get abandoning family and undertaking mountaineering asceticism. Enlightenment can be attained having family, and is a thing that cannot be attained through mountaineering asceticism. Enlightenment starts from accepting Truth and process of understanding Truth.</p> <p>Those people who tried hard for a long time, leaving their family in order to undergo mountaineering asceticism in places like the Himalayas, didn't attain enlightenment, but they performed an action that was effectively abandoning themselves. If someone wanted to be enlightened whilst having Karma inside oneself, without abandoning the Karma, one did things that instead killed oneself.</p> <p>How could one be enlightened with Karma! All that make our thought exist occur from things that happened in ourselves in the past. How could they be enlightened! It is impossible an enlightened being appears in the situation of not removing Karma that has been built in oneself in the past.</p> <p>When I saw people who say they attained enlightenment through mountaineering asceticism, or any kind of ascetic practice rather than through the way of Truth, they were engaging in behaviour that causes more Karma. They performed behaviours which deceived others and harmed others and imposed damage on others. Such things can be confirmed anywhere you go in society today.</p> <p>Enlightenment isn't a thing that is attained by desire or hope, but through teaching. However, that teaching hasn't been transmitted clearly up to now.</p> <p>Shakyamuni was the only person who achieved enlightenment and knew the way to make other people be enlightened. However, such Shakyamuni taught people \\\"Look at things that are in existence! Learn things that are in existence! Know things that are in existence!\\\" only. And when people asked about thing that is in existence, Shakyamuni explained as he saw. Things that are in existence were the way to enlighten people. That&rsquo;s why he taught about things that are in existence.</p> <p>When the disciples asked in front of the Master's last moment of life, \\\"If you die, from whom do we have to learn from now on?\\\" he answered, \\\"Learn through yourself.\\\" And also he said, \\\"I have never taught anything of mine.\\\" This meant that he only spoke of things that are in the world, and things that exist in the world is the way to make people see enlightenment.</p> <p>He taught that when one was wrong one naturally got retribution for the deed, and when one was right one naturally got an appropriate price. It is the Law of Cause and Effect. The cause and effect means that you get a reasonable price against your deed.</p> <p>People are not satisfied with the results that they come to gain from what they have done. It is a trap. Those who can have satisfaction with what they have done, those are the people who are right. People lead their life with wrong thought, and so refuse something that is fair and expect something that is unfair.</p> <p>This phenomenon is more serious nowadays. In order to go and pray in a mountain, people charter a carriage and they put a lot of money under a stone. And that, if they receive an amulet written with red colour, they put even more money. This is because they don&rsquo;t try to gain something by their effort but they hope for a miracle that occurs by a certain object. There are many people with false thought so that such a thing exists. It is inevitable falsehood exists.</p> <p>It is impossible to reach enlightenment unless human beings abandon falsehood. It can be said that people in this age are not blessing themselves but live abandoning themselves. To speak briefly, all the saints including Gautama and Jesus, commonly said that this era is the end of the world. For that reason, people naturally do things that harm themselves.</p> <p>Then why people do such abnormal things endlessly? It is because of ignorance. Ignorance makes oneself be deceived and make one deceive others. Ignorance is the enemy of enlightenment. These ignorant people also say to others that if they believe in them, they would be enlightened. However, far from enlightenment that way makes it difficult to preserve oneself. When a human being's consciousness is ruined, it can be reborn as an animal or plant. It can change any kind of thing. It means that consciousness itself also can be changed to other consciousness when the consciousness is ruined.</p> <p>To attain enlightenment is, as mentioned above, acquiring truth and making truth come into being in you. It is not easy but we were able to get the answer after observing many facts. The answer is as such. When water is continuously poured into a water jar full of polluted water, the turbid water can get out of the jar due to the pressure of water pouring into jar. Accordingly, people should continuously accept teaching of existent things. It is also impossible to accept the teaching of existent thing if the truth is not awakened. Therefore, you should realize your truth. You should make your truth awaken. Good teaching makes human being realize.</p> <p>Then, how to make human beings realise? It is possible to make them enlightened showing them what is. People in this age are ignorant so no one listens to existent thing if I try to make them realize through showing things that are.</p> <p>There are many countries in the world, but people in Korea peninsula, among the many countries, are distinctive. What is the reality appears in the society? As everybody knows it is a gloomy reality. The result is that a lot of problems exist in the society.</p> <p>Falsehood, deception, and things that harass others are rampant because people expect something that they didn&rsquo;t do. Accordingly, the society cannot be good. 'Cannot be good' means the same as it will not be able to be good. It means that more and more problems are created, and people get to live in the problems.</p> <p>People who are not enlightened make themselves move by action of karma. However, an enlightened being looks at what is and lives according to what is.</p> <p>Consequently, due to people who have big enlightenment don't move by the karma in themselves but look at what is and move fit to what is, karma cannot act in themselves.</p> <p>All the wills in the world exist by action. Nothing appears without action. If there were no action in the world, nothing would exist and the world would exist as it were died. Because there are all sorts of action exist in the world, all things are existing.</p> <p>Karma itself also dies if it doesn&rsquo;t act. However, when karma itself dies, it is born again. Things that had kept in oneself, among things that are born again, make them exist in oneself being active continuously. Therefore, it is impossible to expel things from oneself for good that once existed without enlightenment.</p> <p>However, if awakening is big, Karma comes to lose work to do as people are not moved by the action of karma but look at existent thing and act to be fit to existent thing. In that manner, karma itself gets weaker and truth about existent thing grows larger.</p> <p>If there isn't enlightenment, it makes yourself perish, and if there is enlightenment, it makes yourself gradually good. And so, when the truth grows larger and karma gets smaller, it is possible for whomever to reach Salvation through asceticism or love.</p> <p>Depending on whether you know or don&rsquo;t know, the things of the world can be simple or complicated. In fact, things of the world are decidedly very simple. It is decided by simple meaning. However, when we don&rsquo;t know this simple thing it is very complicated to find out.</p> <p>Nowadays human beings find out all kind of things using computers or certain new machines. However, there is a thing that even computers cannot find out. It is 'how to awaken a human being.'</p> <p>It cannot be happen in a day that a society goes down and a lot of people have to live miserably. A thing that falls before a society falls is consciousness. If the consciousness doesn't fall a society never falls. Because the consciousness that moves us is making a world. If there exist a lot of difficulties and the difficulties make our life gloomy, it is the proof that there have existed tremendous wrong things in our society.</p> <p>Having a poor natural environment, Japanese receive hospitality from the world but a Korean doesn&rsquo;t get as much hospitality as a Japanese. It is because of the environment that Japanese society has, a tradition that Japanese society has, and also the system that Japanese society has. The reason that a Korean doesn't get hospitality as much as a Japanese does in the world is because of the consciousness that a Korean has.</p> <p>No matter how much force people to do a bad thing, it is difficult for people to do a bad thing after they have made themselves realise. It is because of things that are in the consciousness. However, when people are not awakened, no matter how pray people to do good things, people cannot do good things. It is also meaning that consciousness exist.</p> <p>Without understanding about the world of consciousness, society comes to ruin the people, and the people come to ruin the society. A society's existence is based on human beings, human beings exist based on the society. A society and human being is the same relationship as head and tail of a coin.</p> <p>Individuals exist based on society and a society exists based on the individual. Therefore, when bad people become influential in a society, that society goes to ruin, when good people become influential in a society, the society is improved. This is eternal Truth.</p> <p>I would like to explain with what method people can get to enlightenment.</p> <p>It is true that Gautama Buddha, who came to the world in the past, achieved perfect enlightenment. As he saw the world of origin and also attained Salvation, it is true that he achieved enlightenment. However, he didn&rsquo;t explain how people can easily reach enlightenment in the process of explaining existent thing.</p> <p>First, \\\"Falsehood must be extinct in order to get enlightenment.\\\" Namely, truth should appear. The meaning of \\\"falsehood must be extinct in order to get enlightenment\\\" is that you have to open your eyes to truth.</p> <p>Second, \\\"You should be able to see existent thing.\\\" Where is right or wrong? Right and wrong doesn't exist in words but come to appear through existent thing. When right result appears it is right thing and when bad result appears it is bad thing. However much you say it is good, it is difficult to produce good thing when you don't know existent thing. That's why you have to be able to see existent thing. You have to be able to know how existent thing comes to being. You have to be able to know the law of cause and effect that how existent thing can be improved or worse.</p> <p>Third, \\\"You must have conscience and courage.\\\" I repeatedly emphasised that there is nothing more lonely and harder than revealing existent thing to the world. Such was the life of saints in the past and so people in history who tried to teach existent thing correctly were abandoned in the world. Accordingly, even if you open your eyes to existent thing you cannot do the work when you don't have conscience and courage.</p> <p>Fourth, \\\"Endless love must be in oneself.\\\" When you have endless love you would try to teach others. When you have conscience and courage you would try to teach right thing to others endlessly. Without one of these it isn't possible.</p> <p>There was endless awakening in Gautama Buddha in his previous life. So himself saw existent thing and learnt through existent thing continuously through the awakening. The endless activity made his karma very small.</p> <p>When you do asceticism to burn a small karma, like Gautama Buddha, with eagerness to get enlightenment, for the perseverance make fire in yourself, you can vanish the karma with the fire.</p> <p>However, such a thing is too hard, and also if such teaching goes wrong it can make one a disabled person. Gautama had accumulated good deeds throughout ages, he could remove bad karma through asceticism. But one with a big bad karma tries to be enlightened through such teaching, that one eventually becomes a disabled person by problems in itself.</p> <p>It means to ruin organs of the body. Injecting air into a tyre, the tyre bursts when the pressure is over the limit. Also when you handle a substance when there is pressure that is more than the substance can stand, it collapse. It is clear that human body organs as well can be damaged when pressure is given continuously or unbearable pressure is received.</p> <p>It is very hard to get enlightenment through asceticism. As everybody has returned from the world of spirits and is living in the world of life, everybody will be able to know if they confirm. No one knows how much they performed good deed or lived ignorantly in the past world. Namely, it means that no one knows things that are in themselves. Before an enlightened being attained the enlightenment, he didn&rsquo;t know he would be an enlightened being. He didn&rsquo;t know to what extent he had accumulated virtue and even what he was. Every body is the same.</p> <p>Because Gautama attained enlightenment through asceticism, he wasn&rsquo;t able to explain enough about the way of enlightenment. He only said enlightenment could be attained through virtue but people don&rsquo;t understand the virtue itself correctly.</p> <p>For example, even if people directly give money to a swindler and be deceived, if the swindler says &ldquo;you did an act of charity.&rdquo; Ignorant people, who are like blind, think they did so just from listening to the words.</p> <p>However, the result is different. These ignorant people even don&rsquo;t know such thing will bring what kind of result. Therefore, people shouldn&rsquo;t judge only from listening to words.</p> <p>Why is enlightenment so important? Does someone serve you a meal if you are enlightened? Does someone give you money? Is it possible to be successful in life?</p> <p>There are many people who doubt these points. However, the reality is beyond those people&rsquo;s thought. The only thing is that others don't bring all those things for you but acquire for yourself. When you need money, you make money through work. It is not making money robbing other&rsquo;s safe but make money through work. In such a way it is possible to be either a president or a king.</p> <p>Goutama said \\\"those who has origin to get enlightenment can be either king or good and wise king, or a great leader when the person is born.\\\" It means that the person is born with the way to be greatly successful and to have great wealth and fame already. Therefore, people come to obtain their lacking through enlightenment.</p> <p>No matter how much you know, you cannot save yourself without practice. You have to burn yourself away searching for what is. If you know existent things your inside burns even when you work hard. Hatred doesn't occur but your inside burns. Then you will get good results through it. The result is the same when you burn your inside for your children. The result is the same when you burn your inside for others. The result is the same when you burn your inside for your husband.</p> <p>It is similar between burning your inside and boiling your inside. When you boil your inside, your inside is painful. Hatred and hateful occurs and inside of you boils. But people don't know whether it is burning your inside or boiling your inside.</p> <p>However, when you truly understand existent thing of the world and feel anxious about either what your husband does, or what your children do, or what people in the world do, your chest burns.</p> <p>It only burns your mind but hatred doesn't occur. Fire breaks out vigorously within you and getting hot without the occurrence of hatred is burning. It is boiling when inside of you is painful occurring hatred.</p> <p>Occurring hatred is accumulating karma, and burning inside of you without occurring hatred is burning your karma. When you love either your children or anything, things that come to light from the person you love make you feel anxious. You are able to burn yourself with the feeling of frustration. It is important to know this.</p> <p>It is not performing an action of virtue going to church, temple or following people in society. The Important thing is that how much you have enlightenment in yourself, and tried to perform love having many objects that you love through enlightenment. At this time, just the actions appear.</p> <p>Fire can begin from the action and that fire makes the karma burn. We need teachings that exist in Truth in order to eventually get to perfect enlightenment by burning ourselves out.</p> <p>People who don't know Truth say as if it is a great thing. But people who know Truth don&rsquo;t say it is a great thing. Truth is what is itself and everything that you see when you only open your eyes.</p> <p>Your highest aim is how you can get enlightenment and how you bless your life. Blessing self through enlightenment isn&rsquo;t far away but just in yourself. It should occur in yourself.</p> <p>It would be a desire of people sending their children to a university. But it is not a great thing to send their children to a university. It is because education in Korea is not creative but memorising. Education in Korea is different from the education in other countries. Education in Korea comes from intensive memory. The method is inputting many questions from books and accepting the questions within the head.</p> <p>Then what happens to the person? The person receives 100 points in the exam, but if you make the person work in a factory, the person couldn&rsquo;t manage to make a product properly. It means that education ruined people&rsquo;s consciousness instead.</p> <p>Education that doesn't enlighten is not true education. It can spoil people in certain cases. Due to the deterioration of originality, people just shuffle off a duty onto someone else without even thinking what they have to do.</p> <p>When we know what is we can eventually say we live by our own will. Not living by the influence of the society but by the will of oneself. Then you should do things that you decided right.</p> <p>Why has our society abandoned our will and live by other's will! As the result, there are many difficult matters which exist in our society. Because human beings are ruined, the world where human beings live comes to ruin. Nobody can deny these words.</p> <p>However, in order for a perished man to be born as a good man again, that person has to abandon their consciousness and get a new consciousness. This is enlightenment.</p> <p>Why enlightenment is important for us is because only enlightenment is the way to save ourselves from danger, and only enlightenment can be the blessing to guide your endless next life to bright side.</p> <p>One who doesn't love oneself is not able to love others. Loving others has a big benefit for me as well. There is no precious thing than getting enlightenment in the world.</p> <p>Enlightenment makes self be successful. If people are enlightened to things of the world, it is inevitable to be a man who is diligent, frugal and honest. It is a great life if you can live diligently, frugally and honestly for yourself. Such a person never can be ruined.</p> <p>In order to not be perished, and in order to get endless oneself, there has to be some kind of enlightenment. The biggest way to get enlightenment is love. That's why love is great.</p> <p>However, how do people, nowadays, see 'love'? They say love is expression of affection that man and woman share in a private place.</p> <p>There exist word 'love' but true love isn't taught. What is love? It is blessing. What I have done is bless the other party, it is blessing the other party and blessing the world.</p> <p>&lt; in April 1998 at Pusan Korea&gt;</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Imports\nvar ___HTML_LOADER_GET_SOURCE_FROM_IMPORT___ = require(\"../../../node_modules/html-loader/dist/runtime/getUrl.js\");\nvar ___HTML_LOADER_IMPORT_0___ = require(\"./3world.gif\");\n// Module\nvar ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_0___ = ___HTML_LOADER_GET_SOURCE_FROM_IMPORT___(___HTML_LOADER_IMPORT_0___);\nvar code = \"<p>Many people live around us today and each of them has a different nature and different aspect of life among the people.</p> <p>First of all, in order to understand what is in us, we should know about consciousness, and about the function of the body. As such, let us explore what is meant by the terms &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; and &ldquo;the human body&rdquo;. Consciousness is the organ that expresses and decides one&rsquo;s own intention, and inputs what we see, hear and learn. The human body is our body itself, and is the organ that exists for the action of consciousness and growth of consciousness.</p> <p>The reason that people have different natures and interests is because things that have been input in each consciousness are different respectively. One interesting thing is that even if a very small thing goes into a consciousness once, it doesn&rsquo;t disappear easily and continuously influence one&rsquo;s own actions. The origin of consciousness comes into being by things that are latent in oneself, and such things exist through what happened in oneself. Therefore, all the activities are the way to make oneself be, and all the things in the world of life exist through actions.</p> <p>If we know &lsquo;What is&rsquo;, and make good things through &lsquo;What is&rsquo;, then the consciousness accepts it. if we know incorrectly and make a bad thing comes into being, the consciousness accepts the bad thing. Things that are accepted in such a way have an influence on the actions of the consciousness.</p> <p>One may want to live well, but the reason this doesn&rsquo;t work is because of things in the self. We call karma those things in the consciousness that cause the self to move, and this karma comes into being through things that had existed previously to the self.</p> <p>If karma disappears from a living one, this one reaches Salvation, and is able to become an enlightened being. Therefore, whoever knows such a thing begins not to make mistakes easily, that is, not to behave carelessly about 'What is'.</p> <p>The reason the human world has wished for Enlightenment is to live knowing such a thing. Also, if there is enlightenment in people, people see &lsquo;what is&rsquo;, and depend on &lsquo;what is&rsquo;, rather than relying on their thinking.</p> <p>The consciousness of a person is moved by things in the past which had been input in the self. The phenomena that appears due to such a thing are infinite in variety. This is why certain people without formal education and inherited property don&rsquo;t make mistakes in what they are doing, and are successful in what they do, so that they live accumulating abundant property. On the other hand, certain people with education in a good university and much inherited wealth do not quite succeed.</p> <p>Such things happen according to the influence of the karma that is connected and descended from the past. However much one studies, if one doesn&rsquo;t realize correctly the things in the world, then such things cannot be changed.</p> <p>There are words from the past, &lsquo;See the person&rsquo;s origin and foundation in order to know the person&rsquo;. This means to see the person&rsquo;s life and behavior in order to make friends with that person.</p> <p>However much you are active, you cannot do a thing that is not in yourself, and you are not able to do a thing that you don&rsquo;t know. Therefore, no one can hide their origin, and the things that are in the foundation of ones origin.</p> <p>The origin of life is made by things that have existed in the self, the origin to be better or worse is decided by things that have existed in the foundation. No matter how much one studies, if one doesn&lsquo;t realize what is, one will not be able to accept good things and make good things exist in oneself.</p> <p>The reason for many of the problems in our society nowadays originates from this point. Then, why do these problems occur? When people do certain things, people who has poor foundation of their origin depend on their thought or depend on others in many cases. In the process people come to make a mistake.</p> <p>Such a thing isn&rsquo;t easily corrected, and repeats continuously as long as there is no enlightenment. And the reason that enlightenment doesn&rsquo;t occur easily to such people is also because of things in their origin.</p> <p>The reason their origin is poor is because the action of karma is big in their consciousness, and this karma causes them to see things of the world through &lsquo;what was&rsquo; in their self, so enlightenment is not accepted easily. The reason that the karma doesn&rsquo;t accept the enlightenment is because that enlightenment does things that extinguish the karma.</p> <p>Enlightenment in the world of consciousness is the way to solve the problems oneself has, and to better oneself through changing endlessly. Depending on whether to know or not know the way, the life itself changes.</p> <p>Life expresses itself through the action of consciousness and accepts what it listen and see. Things that happened here determine not only matters in the world of after death, but also of reviving to life and things that will happen in the next life.</p> <p>The reason that such a thing happens is because the action of life comes to exist in the consciousness and things that exist in the consciousness appear through the action of life. There are many people who are not willing to believe such a thing. This happens in the people who don&rsquo;t have much virtue. People who say there is not a world after death are denying about what they have to experience.</p> <img align=center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_0___ + \" /> <p>What is meant by the world of after death is the world after the action of life has come to a stop, and refers to the world where only consciousness exists in the state of consciousness and body detached. Most people don&rsquo;t have correct knowledge about the things of such a world. Sometimes books about the world of spirits are published but the majority are limited and end as a tale.</p> <p>Everyone comes to meet death if they are born. Most of their consciousness passes through to the world of spirit. The world of spirit can be compared to plants abandoning their self, leaving behind cereals when it bears fruit. Spirits can be compared to the fruits.</p> <p>The fruits keep what happened in the self, and when they meet ground again, they are revived and make a new world of life come into being and begin to act again through things that had been input in the self.</p> <p>The spirits of human beings is also made through the action of consciousness, and the soul that is made in such a way meets a new world of life by things in the self.</p> <p>Whilst not easy to confirm, some different dimensions of the spiritual world exists in the world of after death. This world is strictly controlled by the law of nature, and the spirits of human beings that remain in the world of after death are determined by what was in the self.</p> <p>The spirit of human beings is comprised of gas, with consciousness input in the gas. Therefore, in a certain case, spirits can see and feel like a living consciousness and don&rsquo;t easily assimilate with others.</p> <p>The life span of spirits is different according to whereabouts in the world of after death the spirit remained, and when the consciousness that sticks to the spirit becomes extinct, it is said the life of the spirit is finished.</p> <p>However, things that are latent in the soul do not easily become extinct, and soon transfer to the other world. The transformation effects are different depending on what was in the soul, but generally they revert to the world of life.</p> <p>Things in one&rsquo;s own life are connected endlessly, and one comes to live past, present and future through what was in oneself.</p> <p>One certain thing is that if there are not good deeds done in the self it is difficult that a good self is born. The world makes all things come to exist by the law of cause and effect.</p> <p>The reason that enlightenment is important in the life of human beings is that they should know &ldquo;What is&rdquo; correctly. Because things that were in us are the origin that causes our life to be good and bad. Therefore, if people live without knowing &ldquo;What is&rdquo;, it is living to desert the real blessing of life.</p> <p>The Life of human beings is made up with a consciousness and a body. Consciousness comes to perform the action of life utilizing the organ of a body, and a body helps the action of consciousness through using the structure of the human body.</p> <p>The process of life reviving, as a seed revives through using the energy of the ground, is analogous to the process a soul undergoes.</p> <p>In modern society, just because a person graduated a good university or has a high social standing, it cannot be seen that that person has a good origin.</p> <p>However much knowledge one has, one cannot be a good person if one doesn&rsquo;t know a good thing. So if a person with a poor origin of consciousness takes charge of work great responsibility, then that person will ruin things of the world. However much one is accomplished at study and the brain is active, it isn&rsquo;t true that such a person is good at any kind of work.</p> <p>The reason that there are so many problems nowadays in society is because the society does not value the consciousness of its people, but instead values a person with intelligence. Such answers can be easily confirmed any place.</p> <p>Nature accepts everything but shows existent things as they are.</p> <p>As an analogy, no matter how much one is active, when one&rsquo;s origin is from wild persimmon, the result is to bear wild persimmon, and no matter how much it may act in a poor environment, when the origin was a sweet persimmon, it makes the result bear sweet persimmon.</p> <p>Even if they act from the same foundation, according to their origin, it is made to bear different fruit in the world of life.</p> <p>Growth and change of consciousness happens using the body. Therefore, if there occurs abnormal symptoms or trouble arises in the body, then problems occur to the action of consciousness as a tool. There are many organs in the human body, and the human body either makes power using itself or comes to move by the instruction of consciousness.</p> <p>The Human body can cause trouble to the action of consciousness through disease or physical defect, and in more severe cases, it can decrease the function of consciousness itself. However, it is rare for troubles in the human body to arise because it is controlled and restored by the regulation ability of itself, while it fulfils vigorous life activity.</p> <p>There are instances that trouble arises for the human body. When a human takes food, a substance that is poisonous can enter the body. Other instances are infection of a virus, or when the body is damaged by accident.</p> <p>Another possibility is that a spirit which is not the person itself will stick to the person&rsquo;s body and be active. In that case, it will cause a lot of trouble to the action of the body, and in more serious cases, it ruins the consciousness itself.</p> <p>The object that one has to be most careful of during the activity of life is the spirit of dead people, and these spirits be closed to the human body.</p>\";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/3world.be7685a3.gif\";","// Module\nvar code = \"<p>Why can human beings not escape from the sphere of god, and why have gods endlessly tried to make contact with human beings?</p> <p>The Human world still does not know about things that are in the results appeared by the action of gods. Due to this, many falsehoods existed in the human world and the damage is significant. Therefore, we would like to reveal the truth about such things.</p> <p>First, let&rsquo;s find out about things(matters) that exist in the world of gods and the true color of gods that try to contact human beings.</p> <p>What object do human beings designate as god? The world where only consciousness exists after leaving the world of life is called 'The World of god', and the consciousness that exists in this world is called 'god'.</p> <p>When we observe 'The World of god' where consciousnesses exist, we can find out there are 4 dimensions. However, it is common that gods that exist in higher dimensions do not make contact with human beings, who are in the world of life. If so, what is the true color of gods that have contacted human beings till now?</p> <p>Human society calls the subject of god that appears in the human world with several terms. God, soul, the holy spirit, devil, ghost, etc are terms used about consciousness that is freed from life.</p> <p>These terms all express the same subject. Occasionally, people in a certain category regard the god that they are worshipping as a special subject god. However, it is only they are insisting the same object to be different.</p> <p>Among the consciousness that exist through the activity of life, souls that have attachment, grudge and a lot of problems in themselves stay in the human world even after they have left the world of life due to being seized with problems in themselves. And they try to contact with people.</p> <p>Many phenomena appears to people when gods make contact with human beings. In general, people either say strange words that they usually didn&rsquo;t use, or say that human beings should worship god. And gods try to make human beings know the existence of god through many forms, such as harassing a person&rsquo;s mind, giving human body pain, and gods try to make human beings take its place to vent grudge or attachment using human body.</p> <p>In the human world, for a human being to contact and receive god is a very misfortunate thing, and it becomes the origin to ruin one's own future.</p> <p>Why do gods that appear in the human world try to solve things (matters) in themselves through human beings? In order to know that we should understand how the souls that make 'The World of god' exist, how they are made, and how they come to be.</p> <p>The subject of god that appears in the human world can be examined from two different angles. Most gods are the souls that came out of the human body and a very small part of souls came out of other life form that could act for long period of time.</p> <p>Then, why are these gods trying to make contact with human consciousness? There are many reasons that souls do not realize resurrection for a long period of time after leaving their life and try to contact to human beings remaining in the human world. In general, however, it is because these souls cannot escape from the problems in themselves.</p> <p>Problems, that souls have, have come into existence by things that happened in their activity of life, and it is very difficult to escape from these problems because things that are existed in oneself cause endless action in self.</p> <p>Life(Living things) leave the result, that come to be in themselves through activity, in themselves. In other words, life(living things) makes the result, that come to be by its own activity, exist in its own soul as it is. And it repeats the same action endlessly by the result. We call such thing 'karma'.</p> <p>When a human being with much karma dies, the soul remains in the human world and trys to continue things that are inside itself through contact with human beings. This is because it is not possible for this soul to be resurrected or to move higher dimension.</p> <p>There are four dimensions in the world of gods, and souls go to these four different dimensions individually when a human being dies. Those with little or no action of karma in oneself can go a higher dimension and those souls without a big attachment or grudge are resurrected through the cycle of reincarnation.</p> <p>However, souls that have many things, which happened to them in the human world, in themselves owing to a big grudge and attachment remain in the human world. There are countless souls that remain in the human world after death, and some souls among these are trying to contact human beings.</p> <p>In order to make contact with human beings, souls use a variety of methods individually. Once the soul successfully contacted with a human being, then the soul makes an attempt to control the target. The phenomenon that appears at that time is that the soul trys to inform of its existence by making the human being, who it contacted with, feel pain.</p> <p>The majority of gods that human beings insist they have met till now are either the same as what has been explained above or relevant to similar types of souls.</p> <p>One thing that people who live their life preciously, should think the most important, is to understand the effect on self due to soul of gods.</p> <p>In fact, many people in modern society contact with gods and are seized by them. Especially among people who are seeking religion, many of them live controlled as god&rsquo;s intention.</p> <p>A truly pitiful thing is that many people carelessly speak words that aren't confirmed and act thoughtlessly, without knowing the truth of words that they are saying and their action.</p> <p>The origin of all the phenomenon that is in the world is made by what is and what will be. In other words, things of the world exist by 'what is' in the law. However, we should pay attention that most people who contact with souls deny things in the law and in the origin of the world of phenomenon. Knowing such a thing is very important for self and the future of the world.</p> <p>If gods, that have appeared up to now in the human world, had the ability to bless human beings, a part of the Truth of the world should have been revealed in human society already as the proof of this.</p> <p>However, the reason that nothing has been revealed so far is that the gods that human beings contact are gods that don&rsquo;t know things of the phenomenon world or things which are in Truth. If so, the criterion to evaluate about god should be different in the human world from now on.</p> <p>A person asked me a question.<br/>\\\"Do gods give bad influence on human life?\\\"<br/>The answer is this.<br/>\\\"A Mathematical question has the answer through formula. It isn&rsquo;t right to answer to anything in the world without seeing correctly.\\\"</p> <p>What are things that give good influence to human beings and that give bad influence?<br/>Things that exist (what is) can influence good to us and also can influence bad. The important thing for people is knowing the truth about what is.</p> <p>Nowadays, many people in society are controlled by gods and also people&rsquo;s consciousness is damaged by those who are contacting gods.</p> <p>Shamans or diviners can see through things that were in the consciousness of a certain person using god, but they can not alter good, ill luck, fortune, and misfortune that is going to be happen to that person. On the contrary, in case a person who has not contacted a god, makes friends with a person who has a god, the possibility the person can be controlled by god is high. When people depend on god and obey god&rsquo;s will, they ignore the reality in many occasions and don&rsquo;t feel even guilty having done things that damage others.</p> <p>If there is a person who needs god, that person should first try to inquire about why it should accept god. That person should also think about what result will its own actions bring to self when it makes contact with god and is controlled by god. This is because once people are seized by god, whoever cannot be free from control of god.</p> <p>What is the truth of god that the human world has seen so far? The reason that it was difficult and impossible to conform about god was that the human world was lacking in understanding about the world of god.</p> <p>If someone says he/she saw god, people must confirm what is happening to the person. And people must be on their guard against the person and god until correct judgment come to pass.</p> <p>People who insist that they have met god in the human world force to have blind and absolute faith but doesn&rsquo;t say words of Truth about how does what is come to be.</p> <p>If people are asked for blind and absolute faith for god by someone who is instigated by god of devil&rsquo;s soul and act as they were told, the damages by the devil will occur to the people.</p> <p>As it was made clear already, most gods that appear in the human world were either one with weak will, one with big attachment and greed, or one with grudge that they couldn&rsquo;t solve when they lived with human body. It is the consciousness wandering about the human world after their death and these souls cannot be helpful to the human world.</p> <p>In human history up to now, it was prevalent that human being and god come into contact in the society where big problems occur. In such society many people denied Truth and it was rampant to entrust thing of human beings to things that were in God.</p> <p>Things of the world to be good or to be wrong isn&rsquo;t due to the influence of gods that contacted with human being but the results can be different according to how much human consciousness can understand things of the world and act correctly.</p> <p>If there is religious teaching that can bless human beings in nowadays religions or in gods, then the teaching should be revealed in the human society even now. And people, who are in contact with god and put god forward, have to show the definite proof that god&rsquo;s words are the same as things of reality and they have to say the teaching that is necessary for human life or necessary information for human society.</p> <p>Words that are plausible, stories that didn&rsquo;t happened and stories that cannot be confirmed cannot be helpful to the way of truthful life that people who try to achieve the hope in the human world pursue.</p> <p>Good teaching is to make understood the process that makes good and bad results happen, revealing the truth of what is. However, human society doesn&rsquo;t have good teachings and it is a matter of concern for human life.</p> <p>The reason that holy men appeared in human history and tried to awaken human beings is because human beings couldn&rsquo;t recognize about what is correctly in many cases. In order for human being to understand what is correctly, they, first, must confirm any kind of thing. All the things in the world have answer through the principle and this answer appears through the problem that what is has and the problem which is connected with it. And when you confirm any kind of problems with the principle, you can recognize the answer easily.</p> <p>Gods make problems to human beings rather than being beneficial. Then why has human society worshipped god and thinks god is helpful for human beings.</p> <p>I don&rsquo;t say that all the gods cause damage to human beings. However, gods that remain in the human world appear in the human world because they couldn&rsquo;t abandon things that happened in themselves due to not awakening ignorance in their life. That&rsquo;s why such gods cannot be helpful at all for human world.</p> <p>There is, in religion, a few people who claim that they can cure other&rsquo;s diseases but we should examine the truth of such claim. If they show a miracle it must be clearly explained what the cause was and how such a thing come to happen.</p> <p>However, when we closely observe those who perform miracles gathering many people in religion, we can confirm strange things.</p> <p>The body of human being makes oneself exist by organs that compose the body and action of organs. However, if god could change whatever human beings want, then, why does human society need hospital and why does it have to happen that human beings lose their life due to things that they don&rsquo;t want.</p> <p>If there was an actual case that a miracle happened to a person, the possibility is high that it happened by god&rsquo;s deliberate play.</p> <p>It is difficult for a car to run when a person, who can control a car as it wants because knowing a certain level about the engine of a car and the principle, puts an obstacle deliberately in a certain part of a car. But if the person get rid of the obstacle and return it to primarily state, then the car can run normally.</p> <p>The same as this, if a god come into contact with a certain person and caused abnormal symptoms making an obstacle deliberately in an organ of the body and if the god put the organ primary state, the abnormal symptom comes to disappear. In that case, people say that miracle occurs.</p> <p>Religions in human society make human being closer to god and to be further from things that are in the reality by putting God forward.</p> <p>If religion that put Jesus forward try to give blessing to human beings, it must tell his teaching. But the religion introduces ability of &lsquo;The God&rsquo; and says just believing in Jesus you can be saved and also obtain eternal life.</p> <p>There is not case at all that &lsquo;The God&rsquo; itself influenced in any kind of matter of the world, when we confirm through things that were in the world. Religion says Jesus came to the world borrowing a human body as a son of &lsquo;The God&rsquo;, but there up to now is nothing that is revealed as a proof that Jesus was a son of &lsquo;The God&rsquo;. It is a common sense that in a trial something without proof does not influence Judgment.</p> <p>However, the religion states record as the evidence that Jesus was a son of &lsquo;The God&rsquo; and it is because he was born from the body of a virgin.</p> <p>Then, we can confirm the fact through record. According to record, there was a woman in childbirth and a man in the place where baby Jesus was born. The relationship between the woman in childbirth and the man was that they were engaged to be married. The reason that the woman in childbirth happened to give birth as a virgin is because she hadn&rsquo;t been legally married with the man. She was a virgin as a social standing.</p> <p>If it insists that the baby is a son of &lsquo;The God&rsquo; because a woman became a woman in childbirth as a social standing of virgin which is not married yet, then countless of The God&rsquo;s children are being pregnant at this moment in this country. And if there wasn&rsquo;t medical technology of obsterics and gynecology, the countless of The God&rsquo;s children would be born.</p> <p>To distinguish whether it is true or not about all the matters of the world, it is the most correct to confirm through what is.</p> <p>According to record, Jesus never said, even once, that he was a son of The God while he was active in the world. Jesus had a father and a mother and he said that he was a son of human being.</p> <p>Furthermore, a thing that human beings must know is that it has nothing to do with them whether Jesus was a son of The God or not.</p> <p>What is the use of things that are not relevant to matters(things) of one's ownself and what value does something have when it is not helpful to oneself?</p> <p>The reason that the human world needs Jesus is that he was a very eminent man, he was a man with a big conscience, and he stepped forward in front of human beings running the risk of being in danger and difficulties in order to awaken human being&rsquo;s foolishness.</p> <p>Religion says that Jesus said, \\\"No one can be saved without going through self.\\\" So it insists to receive Jesus and to be saved.</p> <p>Jesus knew a little the principle of the world. He explained that all the things that happen to people&rsquo;s life are the results that come into appear due to things that happened in themselves.</p> <p>\\\"No one can save self without going through I.\\\"</p> <p>Are the object of 'I' and the object 'self' the same or different?</p> <p>They are words that indicate the same object.</p> <p>It is the principle in the world that nobody can save oneself without going through oneself. All the things in the world do not exist by will of 'The God'.</p> <p>One's own life is influenced the most by one&rsquo;s own will.</p> <p>If I go to a construction site and work for a day, I could earn one hundred thousand won(Korean currency, about 80USD) but if I don&rsquo;t do because I am reluctant to work, then I couldn&rsquo;t earn one hundred thousand won. It is by my own will.</p> <p>Whether I go to work or not and make myself starve or have a full stomach, it is not the will of God but it is entirely my own will.</p> <p>If I work hard, and buy enough food and eat, my stomach would be full. If I don&rsquo;t work and couldn&rsquo;t buy enough food owing to shortage of money, my stomach would feel hungry. Such things are not the will of god. It is all caused by my will.</p> <p>Therefore, the words &ldquo;No one can save self without going through I&rdquo; means that oneself must save oneself for oneself.</p> <p>As it was explained above, the human world didn&rsquo;t teach properly things that are important to human beings&rsquo; life.</p> <p>People are not able to distinguish between what is good teaching and what is bad teaching. Furthermore, because people are not able to see what is properly they always understand with their thought and decide.</p> <p>The world exists in the law. The world of the law refers to create a phenomenon when what is meets what is, and there exist things that make all sort of phenomenon in the world.</p> <p>Whoever comes to understand about such things, they can make good life depending on themselves not depending on others.</p> <p>People try to depend their matter on religion, but if they go to religious places they will be deceived twice. I am not saying that churches or temples are to deceive people. However, if people visit such place frequently and try to depend on others, they, first of all, will be deceived by people, and next they will be deceived by god.</p> <p>It would be fair and important that we always confirm the truth about the assertion that religion of today puts forward. If people follow exactly religious teaching which explains the path to reach salvation through 8 right path, they will lose oneself. To loss self means to kill oneself.</p> <p>When oneself is lost thought doesn&rsquo;t occur. Then the person either turned to an idiot or become further blind, who cannot see what is even if it sees. Otherwise, if one became either to see another place other than when they are sitting or see through others mind, it is that the one obtained a god that wandering around in the air and come to say words that the one doesn&rsquo;t know.</p> <p>'Believe in Jesus!' Then does Jesus settle everything for you? It is not true. We have to learn The Truth that made exist what is in the world. The proof of The Truth should be confirmed everywhere in the world. It is because what is is the Truth.</p> <p>Religion always speaks of others. It doesn&rsquo;t teach people to depend on themselves by awakening themselves, but teaches people to depend on Buddha, Jesus or God.</p> <p>However, the world doesn&rsquo;t make all the thing exist by will of Buddha or Jesus. The world makes itself exist rising wills that all the things in the world have.</p> <p>However much you pray, you cannot obtain what you want through pray. God might show you magic due to you pray with your utmost sincerity. However, because god cause to happen a strange phenomenon, it isn&rsquo;t truly helpful to life of human being.</p> <p>The most important thing for human being while they live is to take precaution against god. However, human society doesn&rsquo;t know properly the importance of such thing.</p> <p>If one lent its body to god as religion taught to depend on dead person, if god lead the body, it is the same that the person didn&rsquo;t do anything for itself while living. It is that he/she lived god's life after all, it is resulted the person, who lived others life, abandoned its future. Abandoning oneself, it isn&rsquo;t right thing.</p> <p>The fact that a man was born in human world through life activity is glorious because it is chance to bless oneself.</p> <p>However, todays human world is heaven for Ghost. It is because history is not continued by human being in the human world but many things happen by control of god.</p> <p>If we see Chinese book called Confucianism, thoroughly right words are written.<br/>'The three basic principles in human relations and the five moral rules in human relations'</p> <p>It is very good teaching, if someone who don&rsquo;t know see. But it is very dangerous teaching, if someone who knows see.</p> <p>'Serve King, Be dutiful to one's parents, Be brotherliness with brothers.'<br/>However, the most important thing is missing there. Good words are arranged in there and it request good results but there is not teaching that will produce good result.</p> <p>If human being has the human being character, one would serve well the king and there would be brotherliness between brothers. However, without teaching for perfection of human being how it is possible to make human being to recognize things of the world. And if human being cannot recognize what is, even if you open your eyes you are the same as blind. Buddha expressed it ordinary people were blind with open eyes.</p> <p>Therefore, good teaching like 'the three fundamental principles and the five moral disciplines in human relations' made people further blind with open eyes.</p> <p>Because all the religions nowadays are the same as that, the teaching of religion causes people to lose oneself. And because religions do not reveal what is, people are becoming more and more ignorant and foolish.</p> <p>The best message that we have to bear in mind in this age is to take precaution against falsehood. If people come to recognize what is, people turn to someone who has good sense and with firm character. The world where such people live a lot is bright and affluent. The fact that we couldn't make such a history is the proof that there wasn't right teaching.</p> <p>Energy of consciousness exist in the middle of heart of human being and this energy makes its consciousness(soul) through activity of consciousness.</p> <p>Soul inputs and maintains things that happened to itself in itself. Therefore, acting billions of matters inside the soul moves human being. These are again input in the soul. People could reach Nirvana, eternal life or hell by the soul that was made through out its life.</p> <p>Therefore, it is not that people can obtain an eternal life or be saved doing a lot of heartly pray, or it is not that people can go to paradise doing a lot of donation to a temple and praying sincerely. Whoever recognizes what is and make an effort, can enter into Nirvana, live eternally and can live happy and peaceful life.</p> <p>The destiny of human being is made by things that were in oneself, and by things that are connected with oneself. It is necessary to human beings enlightenment in order to solve problems that oneself has. If one is enlightened about a certain thing, the one can do it without going wrong. That&rsquo;s why enlightenment is important.</p> <p>In order to obtain the self that you want, you first should escape from the destiny that you yourself made. It is impossible to turn yourself to good destiny without abandoning your own wrong destiny. When action doesn&rsquo;t change, the consciousness doesn&rsquo;t change as well. When consciousness doesn&rsquo;t change, action doesn&rsquo;t change as well. This is the law and thing that whoever can see.</p> <p>If human beings come to recognize such things correctly, their life will do very important thing for itself. However, if human beings deny such thing or cannot open their eyes to what is, it is unfortunate thing like abandoning its life by itself.</p>\";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Imports\nvar ___HTML_LOADER_GET_SOURCE_FROM_IMPORT___ = require(\"../../../node_modules/html-loader/dist/runtime/getUrl.js\");\nvar ___HTML_LOADER_IMPORT_0___ = require(\"./poster_tkpa9.gif\");\nvar ___HTML_LOADER_IMPORT_1___ = require(\"./photo_tkpa9_1.gif\");\nvar ___HTML_LOADER_IMPORT_2___ = require(\"./photo_tkpa9_2.gif\");\n// Module\nvar ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_0___ = ___HTML_LOADER_GET_SOURCE_FROM_IMPORT___(___HTML_LOADER_IMPORT_0___);\nvar ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_1___ = ___HTML_LOADER_GET_SOURCE_FROM_IMPORT___(___HTML_LOADER_IMPORT_1___);\nvar ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_2___ = ___HTML_LOADER_GET_SOURCE_FROM_IMPORT___(___HTML_LOADER_IMPORT_2___);\nvar code = \"<img align=center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_0___ + \" /><br/> <p>Nobody knows since when the earth has existed.

The existence of the phenomenon that something once created exists perpetually is possible by Reincarnation.\\\"</p> <p>Let me explain what he said.

I myself do not have actual feeling from time to time.</p> <p>What is Enlightenment? How do you define Enlightenment?<br/>Enlightenment means opening one's eye to the things in the world. Tathagata is the being who opened his eye completely to the world. He is the being who attained a perfect Enlightenment.<br/>Meanwhile, when you can recognise something from learning you are in the state of awareness of something through a certain thing.</p> <p>When I say that I see and know, it means I realise something.<br/>A few days ago, I have heard that there was a Supreme Master TV in U.S.and they make programs of enlightened masters. I would like to send my disciple to them and have an interview with them. She will tell them the definition of Enlightenment. If they ask her 'Can you distinguish the enlightened one from the not enlightened one?',she will answer, 'Yes, I can. Since I have learned from the master of Supreme Enlightenment, I can tell you what the enlightened being can see.'</p> <p>Here is something that you can hardly understand. These days there are lots of people who say that they are enlightened. The real enlightened one must see the things in the world. For example, everybody wishes to be happy. The real enlightened one explains this matter in this way. Where the happiness is. What happiness is. What is the way to happiness. What is the cause to lead you to the goal of happiness. The Enlightenment teacher must see things in this way. Otherwise, we can not agree with his claim of Enlightenment.</p> <p>Somebody who sits in the house can know what happens outside. The enlightened one is not a being like him. The enlightened one can know only when he sees. Some people can tell what is behind the wall without seeing. It is possible for them since one spirit or many of them have entered their body. The spirits see and inform to living people who are possessed by them. They can read other people's mind. Mediums and fortune-tellers do this. In Korea, among the Buddhist monks who are known as the enlightened, there are lots of monks who show this ability.</p> <p>The gods, we call them as spirits, ghosts or dead souls, are in the condition that the consciousness of the dead attaches on energy. The gods can see and recognise something, but they can not express or receive on their own because they do not have the body of life. The energy without the body of life can't do anything. We have a number of farmers among our members. However you pray hard to have god's help, it is impossible for gods even with big power to remove one root of grass.</p> <p>The floating energy does not have its own body. That's why they can read other's minds.<br/>They can see these things but they can't see what is in truth. The world is operated by the things in truth. Then, what are in truths ? They are the causes which come to the origins of phenomena. Every phenomenon that appears in the world has it's own cause. Phenomenon can be seen through your eyes. Green leaves in summer time turn red in autumn.</p> <p>So you can tell who is enlightened or not when you have a little of knowledge. However since people in this era do not have such knowledge they cannot see things in the phenomena. That's why they are wandering all the time.</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<p>You should listen to me with the focus on how you will see this world. I told you about the ideal and reality and I took Cambodia as a good example, where I travelled a few weeks ago. As you know Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in the world. However I've never seen such a country blessed with nature. I went to Phenom Pen from Bangkok by bus and it took 8 hours from the border to Phenom Pen. There were endless rice paddy fields and I could see only a few small mountains and several villages during bus travel. Because they didn't cultivate their land properly people are poor and hungry. When I walked in the street children came to me and begged for money. They are used to follow strangers. I scolded them 'You live in the country that is blessed with such a wonderful land. I came from Korea which has only mountains and a heavy population. Who begs to who?'</p> <p>As I explained to you in last class the tragedy of this country is caused by Pol Pot who had his idealism but no eye to understand the reality. His idea had some reason but he only gave suffering to his people and destroyed the society. He did not know humans nature. He was ignorant about the principle that operates the world. He failed because he did not know what he was doing. This is what I always warn to people in this era. I try to awake people and help them become aware as they are. They should realise the gap between ideal and reality and the danger of faith without verification.</p> <p>I visited a big Buddhist's temple in the city center and met a famous monk who was introduced by a professor in Royal Phenom Pen University. I asked him \\\"Do you have any teachings in your Buddhism?\\\". He answered \\\"Yes\\\". When I asked what are they, he explained about the five precepts. I laughed and said \\\"You speak a lie from the time you get up in the morning everyday but you think you keep the precepts, because you don't know when someone who is blind speaks something that he cannot realise, it becomes lying.\\\"</p> <p>\\\"You speak something about Buddha and his teachings everyday. If you have any one truth of your words show me the proof.\\\"</p> <p>This is very important point. When I asked for proof of their truth, the mood of conversation changed.</p> <p>Here, I emphasise that you also can speak a lie if you speak something carelessly without view or without confirming it by yourself.</p> <p>Here is something I am always very anxious about. There are some people who come to me by the guide of gods. They obtained those gods from their hard pray toward stone buddhas or wooden buddhas. If they earn my mind even once they can get what they want. But the problem is that once they solve their difficulties they never come back to me.</p> <p>Soyun had a friend who was in an extremely difficult situation because of her husband .<br/>Finally she came to me and I taught her how to control him. From my view he was not normal and his terrible behavior was a kind of habit. She applied my advice to him and the effect appeared so rapidly. The position of two was reversed . Now she is a cat and he is a mouse. It took 30 years for her to have her freedom from her husband. And she herself changed as well. She never came back to us and is not willing to meet Soyun either. Most of the people are the same as her. When they find no way they come to me once or twice, but I hardly see them again after they solve their problems.</p> <p>Then why does this happen? I told you many times. In order to gain good you need a bond. We associate with one another as we have fate.When I travelled west of India, sometimes I saw the peacocks. There were always one or two, they never played with the crows or other birds. The peacock was alone, so looked very lonely. Even though he visits crows and begs for company, they don't allow. If he displays with his tail to attract them, they will be upset. The more he tries the more they hate him and are jealous.</p> <p>One day I was in a bar with my old acquaintance and his friends. He praised me and showed high expectation of my role for this society. Then a women requested me to have a chance to meet me. She wanted my phone number. I told her \\\"I may seem somewhat great here now, but you will forget me soon.\\\" Because she had little bond with me. Birds of a feather flock together. Different kinds of origin cannot be mixed. Lots of people came and left when they solved their difficult problems. They never come back. I was nothing more than a public toilet. Few of them remain. A long time ago Gautama had the same condition as me. He walked the long long way until his age of more than eighty, not for showing off himself but for finding people.</p> <p>Here I 'd like to point out one thing you should know regarding Gautama Buddha's way to teach. Today so called meditation has become immensely popular. Buddhist monks say that Buddha was enlightened through meditation, but that is absolutely wrong. It is true when he did not find anything to do he sat down during the period of his practice. He practiced asceticism and he fought against himself through the practice. Since he was born as a prince he had lived in comfortable condition. However he threw himself into extremely bad condition of starvation, cold and hot weather, attacks of insects,etc, and fought against himself and finally won. It was a fighting to find good self. But modern meditation teaches how to leave yourself.<br/>These days most of the meditation instructors teach people to concentrate on their breath. You shouldn't think anything and should leave everything. So I asked them,\\\" Is that what Buddha taught?\\\". They said \\\"Yes, it is.\\\".They claimed that Buddha instructed those practitioners to do like that. That's totally wrong.</p> <p>When a group of people gathered without any particular things to do, they become to wander and to get lots of useless thinking .Moreover, if they loiter here and there with illusion they are likely to commit some mishaps. That 's why he let them to sit calmly and try to meditate and observe about what they saw, what they heard. They were guided to search the way to reach the truths of what happened to themselves. They were asked to survey what was in them and to see what causes create such things. After a close examination they should allow themselves to accept the reality only. That was the best way to cultivate humans. In short, Buddha taught them to think deeply and observe in order to save themselves from falsehood through confirming the truths of what they heard or saw.</p> <p>On the contrary, the existing Buddhism requests you to leave everything. Buddha gave you the way to save yourself, while today's religion guides you to leave yourself. The other spirits cannot invade someone who tries to save self, but if you leave yourself the soul of the dead that was roaming in the air enters to you immediately. You are like a deserted empty car, so other's soul occupies your seat and may tell you, \\\"Have a rest and let me drive your body.\\\" . If you have a weak soul it will suppress you completely and drive you on his own.</p> <p>I always learn from my travels. I say that I rather learn from you and I myself am a guidance of you. I help you to see the world carefully by explaining things as they are. In fact, you teach me. The best guru in the world is the world itself. What exists in the world is the best teaching. People are the elements that constitute the world, so I have been learning a lot from them as well.</p> <p>Recently I was agonising on the matter of how to treat people. I became to wonder how much of truth is allowed to tell regarding personal destiny. You cannot come to me with bad destiny. Even if you came to me by a kind of bond, you will find it difficult to change your destiny unless you cultivate the bond well.</p> <p>The way of the present life is fixed by your karma of last life. We call it as a destiny. This destiny creates various phenomena when it meets with the reality of life. And the karma becomes a 'motae' (origin) which creates your disposition, nature and vision and so on. I always tell you that nobody can be free from their karma which they have done .The ordinary people cannot understand this at all. Moreover when they learn this without any previous knowledge they cannot distinguish my words from a minister's or monk's. Especially those ministers who are the experts to deceive people. They pray for someone who they never met before and it sounds really grateful. Their well trained voice is flowing like the instruments. The ministers, monks and mediums do the same job. But only people cannot separate them because they do not understand them as they really are.</p> <p>When I travelled Thailand a few weeks ago I underwent the same hardships as usual. No matter how hard I tried to meet people and awake them they doubted me, avoided me and didn't listen to me. Several years ago I printed 200 sheets of my message that introduced myself but I still have 100 sheets of them left, because I don't find someone who I want to give it to or who wants to read it either. In my message I told that I was the Supreme Enlightened being and have been travelling endlessly to be helpful to mankind. I appealed that I earnestly required your confirmation on my claims. However nobody is interested in my words, nobody tries to verify it. The only thing what they can do is doubt and guard. Why does it happen ? Because of their karma. They became the monks as they did not have any merit in their past lives. That's why they always deceive people and are greedy. Greed is what you should leave in life because it leads you to being easily cheated by others. If you are greedy you are not helpful to yourself or others as well. You are suffered with ill-fortune. When I see what modern religion does, they always teach people to forgive. They never teach the way to live on the right way. What on earth do you have to forgive ?</p> <p>The most essential teaching is that how people live on the right way. In order to lead people to the right way you should reveal the world. The best teaching is to reveal things in the reality. The world itself is the best teacher. You know how you missed the bread when you were hungry. Someone who has experienced starvation does not waste money because they had learned suffering. The world taught them to save money.</p> <p>If you depend on the other's help, you are in danger to be trapped. If you ask gods' help by a prayer you may get a temporary response but you have to pay back with your soul. What is the result of that ? Your soul will be ruined. It means you have to give yourself to the ghosts and it is too miserable. Therefore, learning what is in actuality is most worthy for your life.<br/>The greatest worth of life is to awake yourself and be aware of true yourself. You can bless yourself through a righteous and grand life.</p> <p>Why is this class precious to you? Because you are the blind one. Because you need someone's guide for your wishes. A good guidance lets you open your eye by teaching things what are in reality. Because everything in the world is fixed.</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<p>December 17 2006 Busan Lecture</p> <p>It's difficult for ordinary people to distinguish a lie from a truth without confirmation. So people are always cheated by a lie when they do not know. The most important teaching of the saints who lived in the world was that you should be aware of untruth.</p> <p>Then what is the definition of a lie? A lie means you don't speak something as it really is.<br/>When I visited the president of the Union of National Spiritualists in London I told him the difference between false religion and right religion. If they teach untruth then they are the false religion. Meanwhile if they tell truth then they are right religion. It doesn't matter whether they are a big group or not or whether they have a long tradition or not.</p> <p>When I travelled India I talked to some Buddhist monks. They told me 'What you speak is the same as what Gautama Buddha said 3000 years ago.' I answered them 'You may be right. As he was also enlightened, so our explanation could be the same when we talk about the same thing. But the problem is that his teachings have been changed in quality by the Buddhists. Like when food goes bad it becomes poisonous and harms people when they eat it. When people learn the deteriorated truths their souls are poisoned by wrong knowledge.'</p> <p>From now on I would like to explain how humans can lead their souls to the eternal life. Many creatures, even lots of spirits, wrong religious people or some people who have heavy karma have been looking for this secret, but nobody understood. However you cannot attain this goal by listening or knowing only. It definitely requires your hard practice through your life to have the result. I repeated again and again how the soul is made and what is the role of life and what will happen after your death. But my teaching doesn't enter to your consciousness well.<br/>Why? Because you cannot see the reality. From your point of view it doesn't seem real, so it's very hard for you to accept my words and practice them.</p> <p>Then, what is the eternal life ? It means that by keeping things in your motae you make them come to life again endlessly.</p> <p>A man makes one soul in him and the soul has everything that happened to him.</p> <p>When I met the vice-chancellor of Pune University in India I have explained about soul. He invited me and asked<br/>'Could you tell me where is my soul ?'<br/>\\\"Yes, I can. But before I teach you I 'd like to ask you one question.\\\"<br/>'Please.'<br/>\\\"Where did a bean come from?\\\"<br/>'A bean came from a bean, right?'</p> <p>He gave me the right answer. Most people think that a bean came from the ground and a bean itself may know that it is from the earth as it roots into soil. After I checked his ability to listen I gave the answer to his question. \\\"That's right. A bean was born from a bean. The earth is its mother-body, while a bean was its origin.</p> <p>The secret of the eternal life is in your motae (origin). If your motae is strong you will not find any problem to come to life again. A bean falls down and links to the earth then it will revive naturally.<br/>Try to plant a bean and observe it. At first you will see a sprout from the seed and leaves from the sprout, and flowers from the leaves, finally a bean is beared from the flowers.When they become ripe, a bean tree stops its activity of life and dies but the new bean keeps everything that has happened to it in itself. Then its fruit revives. In this way what exists, exists forever.</p> <p>Then what makes it possible for you to preserve yourself ? This is the riddle that you have to solve in this era. How can you keep your soul ?</p> <p>After the changing period nothing can be hatched for 30-50 years. And many souls are decomposed by the activities of waves. It means a soul is destroyed. When you lose your motae you cannot be reborn.</p> <p>There have been lots of people who were very interested in this question but nobody could see as it is not seen through a man's physical eyes.</p> <p>I came to the world in this era and saw.</p> <p>A soul of the dead is changed in quality because of its excessive activity. It acts on the ground because of its weight. If it is heavier it feels more like it is still alive. Those spirits try to enter into a living human body when they become more lonely and find it very hard to bear their conditions.<br/>Therefore there is the most dangerous thing that you should be aware of and guard against in this era. Those are the roaming souls of outside. They are desperately trying to enter to the body of a living person. Once they enter they conquer the living body and prevent the activity of the real owner. If you are in this situation and you are not free to act by your own will because of their constant influences, then you don't have a chance to get the eternal life or at the least you will be seriously damaged and unable to attain the level of eternal life dimension.</p> <p>Karma is an essence of the secret of motae. No matter how intelligent you may be, if you cannot control your karma you cannot preserve your motae for a long time. When you can stop the activity of karma you are in the state of nirvana. It is easy to speak and simple in theory but it is difficult in reality. If you sew an apple pip you will have an apple tree forever. Its motae was the apple and it knows how to make apple only. You need the capacity to change what is in you. When you can stop your karma, it is possible for you to move. You need to train yourself for that. That training does not mean sitting like meditation practice.</p> <p>First of all you should be aware of reality and try. How to try ? You should see the reason of the world, then change your way. When you are well trained to stop your karma you can choose what is right for the reason. When you completely stop your karma you are in calmness. You are in peace, so you do not feel whether you live or die. When your soul is light enough after losing the weight of karma it will float in the sky as high as white cloud. It means that your soul stays in a safe space, away from the wave of the changing period.</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<p>Teaching of Tathagata 24 dec 2006</p> <p>I have heard like this from Master Tathagata :</p> <p>The subject of eternal life has been one that has generated much interest among humans. You can live permanently by repeating birth and death when you have certain bonds. You die when you are connected to that bond.<br/>You are born when you have that bond as well.</p> <p>In order to know the worth of life you need to understand a little of how a life is composed and comes to the world again.</p> <p>The origin of life is generated by the activities of the world and that original energy keeps evolving endlessly. When that origin of life meets a bond in the process it is possible for itself to create a living creature. The creature keeps its bond in it and we call it as 'motae '. So, the motae is created by the bond and a life comes back to the world by its motae.</p> <p>Then how can you present the eternal life to yourself ?<br/>Stop your karma, you will live forever. It is easy to say, but actually it is hard for you to control the activities of your karma. You are absolutely controlled by what you have done because of your motae. Everybody has every different way of life because of what is in their motae.</p> <p>All the saints requested others to confirm even what they themselves had taught. But the evil ones or the swindlers never say to you to confirm what they have said. Instead, they order you to trust them. I always emphasize on confirmation before believing something. What I say at this moment also requires your constant confirmation through the things in the world.</p> <p>For example, here is a pear and it can make itself exist forever if it meets a good farmer. All the creatures keep their crystal of all their bonds in their fruit and they revive through their own fruit.</p> <p>Then, what prevents you from revival ? You cannot be reincarnated in case you destroy your energy because of the activities of your karma. Nor can you be reborn when you lose the right time to revive when your soul attaches to the human world. A researcher informed that a seed had sprouted which was in a fossil for several thousand years. It is possible according to the conditions to be preserved. Meanwhile some seeds cannot sprout even one year later when they were worm-eaten or decayed. It indicates that a living creature cannot revive when it lose its energy in its own motae. So, if you stop the activities of your karma you can keep the energy in your motae for hundreds to thousands years. You can stay in the higher space for around 500 years or 1000 years in an extremly comfortable state. That's like having a happy dream. After 1000 years you can be reborn when you come down to the world and get a bond again. In this way you can continue this process for 10,000 years or forever.</p> <p>You cannot stop your karma by your determination or desire to do so. You need to know the way. What is the way ? You should awaken yourself. What is the essence for awakening ? You should save yourself from a lie. How you can protect yourself from a lie ? You should learn from things in reality. If you do not know things in the world you are decieved. If you know then you can take benefit from the world. This is what the world is like. You are always cheated by others because you lack the spirit to confirm. In order not to be decieved you should awake yourself. In order not to decieve others you should awake yourself.</p> <p>The paramount point of the secret of eternal life is that you should remove a lie that is in yourself. It is impossible for you to live forever if you believe in a lie or you have got a lie in you. When you have a lie in you, you follow what your karma orders. In spite of your ignorance you accept what you do not understand and act what you accept.<br/>The way to leave a lie is that you should meet a man of truth and see his life and learn from his life. When you leave some of your lies you start recognizing as it is. The eternal life, deliverance and enlightenment are the some of the best teachings for humans. How can you cause something for these good results ? First of all you need a good bond. In order to find a good bond you should open your eye to the world. Can you go to heaven only if you go to a church and believe in God ? It is like you want to arrive somewhere by the road of illusion. It is like you want to fly without wings. It is a dream of a bear that wants to fly in the sky.<br/>You should regard a good cause and connection most preciously.</p> <p>Here is the way to gain the good result of life.<br/>Firstly, meet a man of truth.<br/>Secondly, open your eye to the things in the world.<br/>Thirdly, do not tell a lie when you can see the world.</p> &nbsp;\";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<p>When you come to this meeting you should have a clear purpose. Otherwise it will not be so helpful to both of us. We haven't met for 45 days during my travelling. I would like to emphasise that you need to try more to know how things happen inside of you. We visited almost ten top universities in U.S. such as Princeton, Harvard, Yale, MIT, Cal Tech, Berkeley, Stanford, Colombia, USA and NYU,etc. Those are some of the best universities in the world. We recorded more than 30 meetings with the professors in a variety of studies. When you listen to our conversation you may easily understand the difference in the result of learning from them and from me. I never met anyone who understood properly about what they learned or what they had been teaching. Even the scientist who won the best scientist prize in the world did not understand the substance in his paper. I also met many scientists who study gravity. No one knew the substance of gravity, including some researchers in NASA. In order to meet them I studied gravity for 30 minutes, but when I met them I said \\\" I searched for your specialty for 2 hours.\\\"</p> <p>Of course, someone of them regarded me as a crazy man.<br/>It was when I met a philosopher who taught at Princeton University.<br/>I told him\\\" You probably never met a person like me.\\\"<br/>He quickly responded \\\"No, I did. But he was a schizophrenic.\\\" And he drove us out roughly.<br/>This is very important.<br/>If I speak slightly wrong I am easily treated as an abnormal person.<br/>A scientist who studies gravity said that every substances of gravity will be revealed soon and they measured the gravity through a lot of collision experiments.<br/>Gravity is not seen with our naked eyes and can not be measured by scientific instruments as well.<br/>What they do is no more than a pressure test.<br/>I always learn rather more than I teach through my travelling.<br/>All of them were too busy to listen to me. Meeting time was very short so I didn't have enough time to tell them something important.<br/>Some scholars were arrogant. Then I asked them.<br/>\\\"How would you explain what you searched so that people understand easily ? What principle will you use for explanation ?\\\"<br/>They could not answer.<br/>I asked one philosopher. \\\"Do you know what is the definition of philosophy ?\\\"<br/>He said that he never thought about that.<br/>It meant he did not know any meaning of what he had learned and had been teaching.<br/>I had a little talk with a student in economics department.<br/>\\\"How much do you spend for your courses ?\\\"<br/>He said \\\"I need $43,000 per year. In my case, I spend $47,000 because my family is in LA.\\\"<br/>\\\"What did you become to know after spending such a huge amount of money?\\\"<br/>\\\"Nothing really. I don't think I learn much.\\\"<br/>\\\"Then why do you go to school ?\\\"<br/>\\\"I need a certificate. My degree will be helpful for my job and marriage as well.\\\"<br/>Those students learn just words without any principle or questions.<br/>They learn how to make their own words and they will teach the next generation.<br/>In this way human's consciousness becomes worse.</p> <p>They never wanted to meet me if I introduce myself as an Enlightened Being. I introduced myself as the best expert of all the parts of studies except mathematics and languages.<br/>I saw the world of their studies from time to time in order to meet those experts.<br/>I became to understand the world soon after my observation for 30 minutes.<br/>I could solve very easily those riddles that the human world could not solve for thousands of years..<br/>I failed to teach them what I saw as they did not give me any chance, but this travel contributed us to understand more this world.<br/>Today in America, the hottest issue is global warming. The temperature of the earth surface is increasing . This problem came from a change of gravity field.<br/>Scientists do not know the basic step of this phenomenon.<br/>How gravity was formed ?<br/>How can the formed gravity preserve itself ?<br/>How gravity loses itself ?<br/>What circumstance destroys the balance of gravity ?<br/>What is the role of gravity on the ecosystem ?...etc.<br/>Those scientists who I met did not have any knowledge about above questions.<br/>Some of them said \\\"Nobody knows\\\"<br/>The earth is run by a perfect science.<br/>It reacts precisely by a slight change.<br/>During my meetings with the scientists I confirmed that my prediction about the end of the world was accurate.<br/>Well, in this situation the important thing is your decision. Will you save yourself or kill yourself ? Will you remain yourself forever or will you die forever?<br/>Everything in the world has been decided.<br/>You can save yourself through your knowledge of the world only. Otherwise you will kill yourself.<br/>There are two major powers to lead this world to the end.<br/>They are religion and universities.<br/>Nevertheless, I do not have other places to visit and talk.<br/>If you want to know, learn from a knowing person. If not, learn from a man who does not know.<br/>The principle of the world is so simple.</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<p>The most important thing in life is that we recognize what is inside ourselves.<br/>Let's study in this class how we will be able to realize them.</p> <p>During my travelling for 5 weeks in America I met lots of people who were very famous for their studies. Throughout the meetings with them I really felt the limitation of human's knowledge. I clearly pointed out things as they were and explained to them with many examples but they did not realize what I showed. What I said seemed totally unfamiliar to them.</p> <p>If you listen to the cd* very carefully and observe our conversation in those meetings I believe that you will easily understand what I say now. In order to know the world you should not depend on your thinking. I asked a biologist who was a professor in Cal Tech, \\\"How much percent do you understand about what you teach ?\\\" He answered with a smile \\\"Maybe 5 percent...\\\" but he corrected quickly. \\\"Maybe less than 1 percent..\\\" I suggested to him \\\" I can help you to achieve up to 80% of understanding within 2 years, will you accept my proposal ?\\\" He said \\\"No.\\\" Do you know why ? He has been studying that for 30-40 years, but he knew he learned very little. He could not agree with my proposal. I explained to him about the process. When you start to learn maths you should learn numbers first, from 1 to 10. Secondly, you need to learn how to calculate, that is a formula. Third, you learn how to see the question by the cases.</p> <p>Afterwards everything becomes simple. Like this, when we try to understand things in the world the principle is the most important. You can not see anything if you do not know how a question is formed. That's why I kept questioning to them, \\\"What principle do you use in searching the matter, in confirming it and in teaching it ?\\\" Nobody could answer properly to this question. And this is the reality of today's world. Although we are a small group and small numbers of people, what we are doing is not so light. We failed to persuade people in this trip but you will realize that our knowledge and information is superior to any other intellectual groups in the whole world. Our members who have been studying here for a long time are very smart.</p> <p>As long as you have a connection with me you can not be bankrupted.

Initially, under my real name, at a young age upon first finding the 'Enlightenment' site, I was looking to have my thought that I had attained an enlightenment validated. The reply and a common theme I got from the website maintainer, Paul Iddon, who trained me somewhat over the subsequent years, was that I must be disillusioned as it is predetermined that only a single Supremely Enlightened being appears in the human world once in about every 3000 years. At the very least I think this preparation helped me open my mind to the potential full scope of the perceptual abilities of a completely enlightened being, if such a thing were in fact real.</p> <p>I've heard multiple other questions were fabricated by another individual as well, but for the different reported reason of lifting Tathagata's spirits.

So when you understand this world in this way, you will solve your questions on your own. Countless things act in this world and what is in the activities creates new one. </p> <p>1.3 In order to see what is you have to free from the influences of Karma, in order to free from the influences of karma you have to awake yourself by certain teaching, and secondary you have to practice the teaching.

What is your suggested method for people to get Enlightenment one small step at a time. </p> <p>7. Is there still hope? </p> <p>Answer from Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Marcello</p> <p>1) You will know me through your efforts on checking up. The enlightened one can show the ways to fulfill human wishes. </p> <p>2) Could you tell me what ties you concretely </p> <p>3) Good question. The Buddhist community, other religions and everybody in the world had better to know this fact. There is a huge difference between the existing Buddhism and Buddha's teaching. That's why my teaching is not received by them. As long as they have their own teachings nobody will accept Buddha's teaching. </p> <p>4) I teach what is. People do not see what is in themselves. I tell the principle so that they can see what is. I work for their awakening by telling the matters and examples so that they can confirm what is in the principle. </p> <p>5) I just see how the world works. I do not deceive others or use magical power. </p> <p>6) Try to observe, check and realise how the thing come into being through what is in yourself </p> <p>7) Hope of what? Hope always exists .

All the people should be delighted. But the question is: are they really?</p> <p>1a) Your personal history says enough. Breaking those 'walls' is a problem with two solutions: Enlightenment of pain and see beyond, or be hurt in pain and just see the pile of dust.</p> <p>1b) I think fulfilment of wishes has everything to do with the right attention. What do you think?</p> <p>2) What ties me personally and concretely are the rules made by others, mainly government-rules. For example: We are not allowed to build a home at any empty spot. We are basically not allowed to trade between two people, without making profit and thus taxes.. etc. There are too many rules. For example; the laws of justice could be reduced by half by just having: &quot;a person may not harm another on purpose.&quot;</p> <p>3)...I see. So, the same problem exists within world-religion: There are too many rules, while the most of the original teachers didn't make them.</p> <p>4) Most people do not see what is in themselves, because they are only concerned about the visible benefits: People do see what is in their wallet.

The enlightened being is free from his karma while the ordinary people have their karma. That's why we have a different view. In order to remove the wall they should leave everything they have or I should do. But it is impossible for me to accept falsehood because I am already enlightened.

If you really have your intention to obtain the enlightenment it is very easy in the present circumstances. Because I can guide you to the way. </p> <p>There are too many wishes that the humans have and they may be different, so people cannot fulfill their wishes through only right attention.

Thank you. Its been more than 10 years that I had been in this quest for enlightenment, searching in many ashrams, questioning so many so called gurus. Every time I spent a little more time with them I realized they have been repeating from the same books I have read about religion, philosophy like a bio computer. I have spent years meditating alone and with groups doing many meditation techniques, but all is failed. </p> <p>Reading books, J.Krishnamurthy, Osho, Ramana,Zen, Tao ,Internet pages ,didn't help. </p> <p>Conceptually I know that I am searching for that which cannot be searched. I have also heard and read that everybody's nature is enlightened only one has to discover. But all is just thoughts in the head and doesn't help. Mind keeps repeating like a parrot. I am frustrated with this bullshit. and time is passing. </p> <p>I don't want to know ABOUT enlightenment. But I want to KNOW enlightenment. I want to know the TRUTH. </p> <p>Something clicked inside me when I read your direct and to the point responses when I saw your website. I need a living master who can show me the Truth. Can you do that ?. I felt an urge to meet you. Are you in Pune or coming to Pune.

You should learn about things in the world to obtain them. First of all, you need to meet an enlightened teacher and learn from him about the principle and the way that the world works. After that, you should follow those conditions. The term of enlightenment means that you open your eye to the world. When you open your eye to the world it's easy for you to realise that everything in the world is operated by the Truth. </p> <p>I usually stay in Korea, London and Malaysia.

If you have not had any chance to learn the fundamental teaching it must be difficult for me to help you understand something easily.

I want to realize the truth rather than just an information. </p> <p>Please let me know how do I start. </p> <p>Regards, </p> <p>Pradeep</p> <p>Dear Pradeep </p> <p>In order to be aware what is in the truth,first of all, you should open your eye to the things in the world. There are some steps in the process of opening your eye to the world. Many kinds of ways for enlightenment have been introduced through the books and sayings but it was not easy for people to attain enlightenment because their content didn't have enough proofs. In order to know what is in the truth you should learn the basics of how you open an eye. Secondly, you will go through some steps. At first, you should listen to the fully enlightened being about the ways. I have met lots of people on my travels. Whenever I met some people who gave me the same questions as yours I gave the same answers. The answer was that you should meet a man of truth and listen to him the world and aware yourself. Next, you should realise things in the world with your much of understanding through the first step, then you will see the phenomenon that your conscience and courage are generated. When your conscience and courage are grown enough you are able to practice love for the world for the first time. You can remove your karma by the practice love.

I was watching a Christian television show and at the end of it, the host lead a prayer for salvation. I was crying at the time. I prayed along with the television host and I sincerely meant everything I prayed. After the prayer, all at once, I felt an indescribable sensation burst from inside my chest and flow outward causing me to curl into a ball, while my eyes could see nothing but white light.

But as a small child I wasn't able to articulate not only to anyone else, but to myself what I was feeling. Four years ago I was handed a book about seeing the light. It was a very short book (not that many pages) and I finished at lunchtime in my office at work. When I finished, I looked up from the book and my entire office was filled with white light. I felt very blissful and almost euphoric when I finished it. I had always said that I was a Spirit in with a body, not a body with a spirit; as we all are. I believe that we are all on this earth to love and be loved and I try to practice being a spiritual being everyday.

While Buddha was so capable to see and travel through the entire universe, how come Buddha did not know that the earth was round and earth was revolving around the sun, but not the other way around?

Buddha taught, for example, that the earth is flat. This has been contradicted by direct perception. Accepting all of it, then, strikes me as difficult and opposes a basic Buddhist attitude of questioning and skepticism. I think faith and skepticism can fit together in the same person. </p> <p>Biography of Dr. Jeffrey Hopkins is given on a website.</p> <p>BIOGRAPHY: Jeffrey Hopkins is Professor Emeritus of Tibetan and Buddhist Studies at the University of Virginia, where he has taught Tibetan Studies and Tibetan language since 1973. At the University of Virginia he served as Director of the Center for South Asian Studies for twelve years and founded a program in Buddhist Studies. His more than twenty-five books include Emptiness in the Mind-Only School (1999), Cultivating Compassion (2001), and, as translator-editor, His Holiness the Dalai Lama's How to Practice (2002). From 1979 to 1989 he served as His Holiness's chief interpreter into English. </p> <p>Jeffrey Hopkins, Ph.D., served as the chief interpreter to the Dalai Lama for a decade. A Buddhist scholar-practitioner and the author of more than twenty-five books and translations, he is Professor of Tibetan and Buddhist Studies at the University of Virginia, where he founded the largest academic program of Tibetan Buddhism studies in the West. He lives in Charlottesville. </p> <p>Alan Watts (a famous philosopher) also describes the Buddha as Flat-Earthist</p> <p>Refer To 37th Paragraph of the Article on a website.</p> <p>37th Paragraph (Buddha a flat-earthist) </p> <p>[37] This method of dialogue is not simply a discussion between teacher and student. The teacher imposes a discipline of meditation, prayer, etc. to make the student experience reality&mdash;without conceptions, beliefs or desires that maya creates&mdash;firsthand. An individual cannot be simply told that there is or is no ego&mdash;he must experience it through discipline for himself. Watts gives an example of how someone who believes the Earth is flat cannot possibly be talked out of believing the supposition because the flat-Earthist says, &quot;Look out the window and see, it's obvious&mdash;it looks flat.&quot; The only way to convince him is to literally bring him to the edge that he believes exists. But to get to the edge, the individual needs to use a discipline, a method, so that he does not walk around in circles. So the flat-Earthist is led by the teacher along Latitude 40, for example, strictly and rigorously. When he goes around the world and winds up at the place where he started, the individual sees that the Earth is at least cylindrical&mdash;and then go through other rigors to find out the Earth is indeed round. </p> <p>Alan Watts Biography is given on a website.</p> <p>Alan Watts (January 6, 1915 &mdash; November 16, 1973) was a philosopher, writer, speaker, and expert in comparative religion. He wrote over twenty-five books and numerous articles on subjects such as personal identity, the true nature of reality, consciousness and the pursuit of happiness, relating his experience to scientific knowledge and to the teachings of Eastern and Western religions or philosophies (Zen Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, Hinduism). </p> <p>Also Refer to the Following Paragraph in Which the Buddha Explained His Disciples about His Abilities and Strengths:</p> <p>Book: The greatest Man Who Ever Lived: The Supreme Buddha, Chapter 20, Page 124 </p> <p>by Weragoda Sarada Maha Thera </p> <p>Buddha said: &quot;O Monks, I can utilize all the psychic powers I like. I can appear as many though I am just one. I appear as two persons, and then merge into one. I will appear to be seen by all but I can remain unseen by anyone. I can go through walls, fortresses, rocks, without touching just as moving through the air. I can go inside water and also on water. I can travel through the air like bird.

Then, a question was asked in the commentary how the Buddha managed to maintain his body without food for three months in the celestial abode. The answer was given as follows: The Buddha is the Supreme one, who knows everything in the Universe without exception. That's why, he knows the time what he needs to do, for example, the time to eat, to teach, etc. The Buddha created another body, which was identical to himself and took over his teaching when the he went collecting his alms in the human world. </p> <p>The aforementioned articles give evidence that the Buddha was a flat-earthist</p> <p>and at the same time he could travel throughout the universe and can even touch the sun and moon.</p> <p>Why didn't he know or feel that the Earth was round? </p> <p>QUESTION-1</p> <p>How did Jeffrey Hopkins or Alan Watts know that &quot;Buddha taught that the earth was flat?&quot;</p> <p>Where did they get this information? </p> <p>Do you know the correct reference of any Sutra number cited in any Buddhist scriptures? </p> <p>Did Buddha really teach that the earth was flat? </p> <p>QUESTION-2</p> <p>When he was fully enlightened, it is known that the Buddha saw the entire universe </p> <p>with his third eye, and even astoundingly the Buddha was capable to travel to </p> <p>the Tavatimsa Deva realm and taught the Abhidhamma continuously for 3 months </p> <p>to an audience of Devas including his passed-away mother.

Recent scientific research shows Buddhist mindfulness only enlivens the left hemishpere of the brain. Transcendental Meditation enlivens the whole brain. It is said that only 500 people achieved enlightenment as result of teachings from Buddha. That is not a very impressive figure. For you own enlightenment to learn what meditation really is, I suggest you visit a local TM center and from one introductory lecture you will know more about real meditation and enlightenment than you know now. I only say this from reading your answers to the seekers who question you about enlightenment and meditation which it seems you have no personal experience with. </p> <p>Steve</p> <p>Answer From Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Steve,</p> <p>Some of the most important things in the conversation with the enlightened being are grounds and truth. You should show the ground that your claim is true. There is no real record that somebody could be enlightened through meditation practice. I would like to tell you about enlightenment, as you'd better to know it by using this opportunity. Enlightenment means opening an eye to the world and if he is enlightened, he can see exactly what is in every kind of question about things in the world and tell the truth of them. However, I have never read any records that this kind of being appeared by meditation practice. When Gautama Buddha acted he let the practitioners, who came to learn from him, sit and meditate when they don't have something to do. However meditation that Buddha taught was not like modern meditation. He taught practitioners to meditate and observe how they can see and confirm about what they had seen and heard. I never found any one place that practice this kind of meditation. If my words are wrong you should show me the evidences, meanwhile if somebody denies my evidences I will let you confirm it. </p> <p>Tathagata</p> <p>Further Response from Steve</p> <p>Dear Tathagata</p> <p>Thank you for your reply. The evidence for meditation is the coherence of the brain waves measured by eeg* machine. Buddha's teachings were recorded 400 years after he lived so I doubt much of what he taught is what is taught about him now. The TM movement has the science of enlightenment as measured</p> <p>by the funcitoning of a stress free nervous system. When they used eeg* machine on Buddhists doing mindfulness, it showed only the left hemisphere of the brain being orderly, that is not wholeness. I appreciate your thoughts.</p> <p>Reply from Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Steve, </p> <p>I don't want to deny the function of modern mechanism. However I can tell that it is impossible for any machine to understand exactly something in humans consciousness and organs of human body. </p> <p>The activity of brain is like the role of the sources of electricity, so it can be compared to the battery of a car. If the driver presses the accelerate with power, the battery will generate more power. Meanwhile if the accelerator is on 0 point, battery does not work. </p> <p>We can not not tell if the consciousness of the driver is good or bad from the activity of the sources of electricity. We cannot tell if someone is enlightened or not, if his teachings are right or not from some part of human organs. </p> <p>We only can tell if he is enlightened or not by confirmation of the facts. You should focus on the criteria that does he speak truth or untruth. It will tell you if he is good or not. </p> <p>Tathagata</p> <p>*EEG is an electroencephalogram, it's used to measure brain waves / patterns, electrical activity of the brain</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Edward</h3> <p>Dear Tathagata </p> <p>I read your website with interest however I am uncertain about some things can you answer. </p> <p>1) Are you Maitreya Buddha ? </p> <p>2) If so then this question on your website does not make sense.. </p> <p>&quot;Shakyamuni Buddha prophesied Maitreya in the future and Jesus as Messiah at the end of the world.

Do you have a book to sell ?</u></p> <p>I have written a few books, however my books are not popular at all, that's why I cannot say I sell my books, because few people buy them, but you should know this, not everybody buy and read good books and people will not recognize the worth of the books until very long time passed. </p> <p><u>4. How does one determine which Tathagata is real ?</u></p> <p>I'm wondering who claim that they themselves are Tathagata, but I have not met anyone of them. Nobody has introduced as a Tathagata in front of me. Secondly,it is very simple to confirm the real one. You can confirm them by the things in the world. If he realises them he is Tathagata, if not, he is not. </p> <p><u>5. You said in 1984 that mankind as we know it will end. It is now 2006. Did something change ?</u></p> <p>There is no change. I have not confirmed the contents of the Website that you have read. Because I calculated that period by the principle and the problems in the present, you will find little mistake. The world is fixed and what is fixed has been operating. If my prediction is not correct the system of the world will face tremendous disaster. </p> <p>Tathagata</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Pol Shappy</h3> <p>Dear Tathagata,</p> <p>I recently found the website of a man who claimed to have originally done work to help create the new world after the changing period. His name was Gahng Jeung-san, and his title is Sahng-jeh-nim... during his</p> <p>life, he wrote this book called The Sacred Book of Dao. He died sometime around 1909.</p> <p>It appears to me like this man had an enlightenment similar to that of Jesus. Can you confirm this for me?</p> <p>There is a website created by one of his followers. It's available in Korean, so you can read it without a translation.</p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>Pol</p> <p>Answer From Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Pol,</p> <p>I have been tried to know what did he do really but I could not find any way to confirm any facts in what he said. In this reason I absolutely do not see him as a man who opened his eye to the world. So, I request you to check on your own why he has so many followers. Because I find it very hard to tell you, a foreigner, what I have seen and known about him. </p> <p>Good teaching must be in the reality but I cannot see any actual thing in his words. That's why I believe that he was the blind or an extreme idealist.</p> <p>Tathagata</p> <p>Further Respose from Pol</p> <p>Dear Tathagata,</p> <p>I appreciate your response so much. I'd like to say that of all the people in the world, I believe it is a person like me who can appreciate the burden you carry. You see, throughout my life I've always had a big interest in truth. Whenever people have come to me with questions or problems or pain, I always knew exactly here the problem lied, but nobody wanted to listen to what I was saying. Some people made fun of me and some people began spreading lies about my heart or even about truth itself. I saw so many prophets of the past and wise people in the current time. However, none of these people (except Gautama Buddha) had succeeded in really revealing themselves as who they were. I began to feel that it was because of that, that they had failed. I felt that all the wise people around me were similar to me, but none of them had good enough karma to see the importance of truth. My thoughts turned to Shakyamuni, and I felt my life was so much like his. Last september, I had an experience that fits your description of enlightenment. However, the difference that I've noticed is that while I was able instantly answer things in truth, it was as if I had to teach my way out of my mind by removing my karma. With the appearance of Maitreya Buddha, and his demonstration of the way to knowing the world, I knew what I had to do with my life. In exactly the same way that I preached to the various elements of my karma, I had to reveal myself in the world as the same person. As I began to do so, people began to listen to what I had to say, some could accept it, and some could even understand it. However, nobody could accept any description of me. In recent days, I'm </p> <p>beginning to realize the importance of introducing myself from the very beginning. Because of that, I know what I must do.</p> <p>Like you say, the world is my teacher. So, if there are any kinds of questions you would like to ask me in order to confirm anything, I can answer them.</p> <p>Answer From Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Pol,</p> <p>You said that you have realised a truth in the world. </p> <p>I would like to hear your answer to my questions. </p> <p>Where is the truth? </p> <p>What do you indicate by the term of truth?</p> <p>Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Tathagata,</p> <p>By Truth, I mean the world. By truths, I mean the facts of the world... For example, there is the 'truth' of a fact and there are falsehoods about that fact.</p> <p>There are numerous means of opening one's eyes to truth, and the Tathagata uses those numerous means to teach people according to what they need to hear.</p> <p>For example, the Tathagata speaks about 'truth' and 'falsehood' because humans are considering things in terms of 'truth' and 'falsehood', but the true nature of phenomena is not concerning 'true' and 'false'.</p> <p>Further, the Tathagata speaks about the principle of rebirth. Although what he is saying is true, the principle itself was conceived of by the Tathagata as a way to cause people to understand the Truth (the world). Another example is the Tathagata's teaching of eternal life...although the Tathagata speaks about removing one's karma to get eternal life, that's a way to cause people to progress and come to see the principle.</p> <p>Dear Pol</p> <p>I have one son. What do I need for changing him into a good man ? I would like to hear your opinion.</p> <p>Tathagata</p> <p>Further Response from Pol</p> <p>Dear Tathagata,</p> <p>You need the way to change your son a good man. First, you should</p> <p>teach about the fundamental principle in the world, so that he can </p> <p>become aware of his life and motae.

I am very glad I came across the internet site where you describe your enlightenment and life. I have gone through huge changes this last year and now realize most of my life I have never really been truly happy. I was always a really quite, shy person, but thought that was who I was. Last year roughly I went into a serious depression and some how miraculously god/higher/divine touched me. as far as I remember the morning this happened was the beginning of december.</p> <p>I have a rough description written down and my many notes of all the feelings and thoughts I was having at the time. Theres so much I could type now but feel the email would go on quite a bit. The previous weeks I had been reading a course in miracles book, and had been following the exercises of forgiving everyone (atonement) or more accurately forgiving 'my self', understanding the human condition Ego,duality mind. The morning the big change happened, I woke early with many thoughts appearing to me, felt an energetic prescence, connected. </p> <p>Was a bit tearful and could see energies in the room. felt very still. I later had the urge to sing something I rarely did and to my amazement there was no voice in my head saying you sound terrible etc, I felt and do now too so much happiness and peace. Since then I have done some research/ believe been guided to articles etc. amazing 'coincidences' happening daily all the time, not that I believe in coincidences anymore. I had applied and have been accepted into university to study development studies. I still see energies some more distinct now, a lady with her eyes closed, very peaceful face with a hood on always appears from my</p> <p>bathroom tiles. I cannot/ havent been able to communicate with her but feel drawn/protected by her. There are some other faces I see in the bathroom tiles but dont feel drawn to them. I have very high intuition now.

Secondly, you should understand as soon as possible what you lose and what you obtain from the contact with the third soul. When you find you are in peace you are in the situation that your own consciousness stops to act. So you need to know what kind of result of life you will have from that connection.

In fact, there were lots of things to make good money in everywhere in the world at least five years ago. But I cannot find them now even with my sharp eyes. People's forecast are not much wrong. The world will be suffered by a severe financial collapse in the near future. Politicians use something very higher mathematics. They usually use a kind of fraud policy because it is helpful for them to maintain their power and popularity. However they do not take any responsibility for the result.

After I got 'uitong' I checked some record but I did not find anyone who used it. However uitong existed in a long long years ago and handed down. In order to get uitong you need an enlightenment and training later. You should let your energy go out and come in freely and need more than 90% purity of your energy.

During our travelling we met lots of people and most of them were scientists. We got some useful information from them. According to their information many of them are concerned about global warming. So I traced to find the cause of it. As the result I found the cause of gravity crack. In order to understand the crack of gravity field you need a quite good basic knowledge. But I could not meet any scientists who have that knowledge during my traveling. That's why I agonise how can I explain it to you so that you could understand. From many thousands years ago the end of the world has been predicted. And it is just beginning by global warming which is caused by the crack of gravity zone. Global warming was caused by the activities of the inner core of the earth. Inner core has started it's action as the force of gravity field became weaker. This activity makes core amplify rapidly. When it creates the amplified energy, that energy is going to be exploded on the earth. I say this phenomenon as that the end of the world and it will happen soon.

First of all, no matter how I explain to you about the appearance of those who had the third eye. I want to know how you can understand about my explanation through which method because there are few or no records to show the appearance of those who had the third eye.</p> <p>The third eye is the seal of one man who was born with a special mission in the world. The frequency of appearance of those who had the third eye is just one or two men during 5 to 10 thousand years. If you want to know more than this, you should come and see with your naked eye what the third eye is and I think it will be good for you to listen to the explanation about it. </p> <p>However, to verify this kind of thing is very valuable for your life, more than what you will pay for coming here. </p> <p>2. There is one principle in the world. According to the principle, gas can be changed to solid in some cases and solid can be changed to liquid.</p> <p>Pure energy (Jin Gi) of the body gathers on the center of forehead and forms into the third eye. If we dissect the body, this is just one of the sarira. So, this is a material and it's just a material which has special nature. </p> <p>3. I've never seen any records to show the third eye on Gautama's forehead. When Gautama was alive, there wasn't any camera. Therefore, the evidence what you saw is not a photograph taken in real life. If someone had drawn it, he or she could add one symbol as a seal of saint on the picture. I can not answer to this question because I didn't verify that directly. </p> <p>4. If one man who had attained supreme enlightenment had come to this world with a mission for saving mankind then the third eye would appear on the man's forehead.

Truth are the actual thoughts a person is having during a time period. </p> <p>Secondly perfect enlightenment will only occur when humans assume energy forms and are able to bind with the universe, there is no proof your consciousness binds with the universe apart from your word. </p> <p>Thirdly I would like whatever proof you might be able to offer me about your enlightenment, anything.</p> <p>Regards </p> <p>Marios</p> <p>Answer from Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Marios,</p> <p>I am very confused how do I understand your question. Firstly, The Truth means something that has been determined, and we name it as the Truth only on the condition of no alternation. The Truth is not made by someone but it has been determined. That's why you shouldn't deny it. In order to know if your words fit in the Truth or not you should see them on the living reality.</p> <p>Secondly, it is very important for you to understand what enlightenment is. In a word, enlightenment means opening the eye to the things in the world and able to see 'what is'. There is no relation between the one who opened the eye and the energy of universe. The word 'universe' is used a lot by the most of the liars. When they use this term, they have to explain the standard and the background of the universe, such as what is the sphere of the universe or what happens in there. As such explanation is omitted, it is very difficult for me to mention about it. </p> <p>Thirdly, I can show you the proof of the enlightenment immediately, but the blind cannot see the things in the world however much I indicate them. So, it is important for you to open your eye of consciouseness through enlightenment so that you could see the world. All of the proofs are in everywhere. </p> <p>Tathagata</p> <p>Further response from Marios</p> <p>Dear friend Tathagata,</p> <p>Firstly though I can't go into a deep explanation of the subject, I do believe my eye of consciousness is partly or maybe more, open, as I have the &quot;ability&quot; to read peoples' thoughts and project mine in their mind.</p> <p>Secondly what is the Truth which you believe in, and that as you claim can not be altered?</p> <p>Marios</p> <p>Answer from Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Marios</p> <p>I could understand your circumstance after I listened to your email. I know that some people can read other's mind or thought by using the power of the other spirits when they approach to them. But at the moment you meet me you will have to rethink deeply about your ability. Because that spirit can not read what is in a higher consciousness. </p> <p>I frequently speak this sentence to awake people-'Things in the world has been determined.'

If so, what would you look for as an indicator of his enlightenment ? </p> <p>I remember praying to God from a very young age, about 5 or 6 years old, to become the wisest man in the world. I would read stories about Solomon, and wish for his disernment. I cannot judge you as enlightened or not, because I haven't seen significant proof in either direction. however, if you are, then I envy you... as unenlightened as that is. </p> <p>Whether you are enlightened or not, I think the world needs someone like you.</p> <p>~Michael</p> <p>Answer from Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Micheal, </p> <p>As you did not reveal the matters that made people regard you as a wise man, I would not like to value on your wisdom. </p> <p>Enlightenment means opening the eye to the world and having a wisdom eye to see things in the world as they really are. </p> <p>It is possible to control chi by chi. In some case I do this in order to heal other's disease or save their lives from danger. However, I never tested to stop a bullet by chi and don't think it is possible. </p> <p>I can tell immediately if the person is enlightened or not. I indicate what is in reality and check if he sees the things in reality exactly or not. </p> <p>Tathagata</p> <p>Further response from Michael</p> <p>Dear Tathagata,</p> <p>I didn't ask you to place value on my wisdom, what use would it be for me to tell you why I am wise ? or give you wisdom ? even a fool can boast; even a fool can give wisdom. in my opinion a wise man should use wisdom to guide his own steps, not the steps of others. if he first guides his own steps with wisdom, only then will the steps of others be guided; because they will follow in his steps. my reason for saying this is; how can a wise man judge if he is wise or not ? perhaps he is a fool forcing false wisdom upon others, but if he guides his own steps then others will decide on their own if he is wise or if he is not.</p> <p>also, I asked you about chi, you told me it is possible to use, but not how to strengthen my ability in using it.</p> <p>you said you could tell if someone is enlightened by checking to see if he sees things in reality exactly or not. first you must ask yourself if your own perceptions of reality are correct. a person cannot judge this about themselves as a fact. how is it that you are able to say someone else is seeing reality correctly if you do not know if you are seeing it correctly?</p> <p>I do not mean to offend you in what I have said, but you have said yourself that one must test anyone who claims to be enlightened.</p> <p>~Michael</p> <p>Further response from Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Michael</p> <p>People judge whether they are wise or not by understanding what is inside them. If you can not see what is in reality, It is very difficult for you to judge other's view. For me I can tell whether the others can see or not by confirming in reality what we we have seen. </p> <p>Tathagata</p> <p>Further response from Michael</p> <p>Dear Tathagata,</p> <p>Everyone can see reality,</p> <p>but seeing reality correctly is not something that can be determined by the viewer. let me tell you about something my 3rd grade teacher did for my class. she set a board in the middle of a table, with one student on each side and asked them, &quot;what color is the board&quot;. one student responded, &quot;it's white&quot;, the other quickly replied, &quot;NO, it is black!&quot;. soon the students were argueing with each other. </p> <p>then the teacher said, &quot;wait a minute&quot; and she turned the board around... it turns out that one side was black and the other side was white. So wisdom may dictate the reality you see, but that same wisdom may be useless from another person's view of reality.</p> <p>I enjoy discussing this with you, thank you for taking the time.</p> <p>~Michael</p> <p>Further reply from Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Michael,</p> <p>Black is black, white is white. It is wrong if you describe black as white or white as black . But if you say black as black, white as white you are right. </p> <p>Tathagata</p> <p>Further response from Michael</p> <p>Hello Tathagata,</p> <p>That is true, but if something is both black and white, you would be wrong to label it as one or the other, simply because it is a single color from where you stand.</p> <p>You also said that you knew how to heal with chakra... will you please tell me a way to increase this ability in myself?</p> <p>I also have a question about your claim of enlightenment. when you were younger, you were not enlightened... is that true? then you became enlightened, is that true as well ?

And everyone says that he's a bona-fide spiritual master. </p> <p>They attract young and unexperienced people who then became their desciples. </p> <p>All those teachers support their teachings with so-called holy scriptures, </p> <p>but sometimes it seems that all that brings about more chaos in human minds </p> <p>than goodness. I wonder whether in your travels have you ever encountered a </p> <p>person or spiritual masters of whom you could tell : yes,it seems that this master </p> <p>is a real one who knows truth,who can be called 'enlightened', and whose teachings </p> <p>are worth to be recommended to others. I don't want to speak about those others </p> <p>as dishonest persons ( I rather do not use such expressions), but I would rather say </p> <p>about them as not knowing the truth, and if someone is away from the truth then </p> <p>how can he/she teach others.But, unfortunately, it happens very often and in the </p> <p>end a lot of disciples end their ways mislead and in still worse circumstances than </p> <p>in the beginning. And here we 've got a problem of today's world : you say </p> <p>in your teachings that it is an important thing to be aware of the way </p> <p>the mind works (in conjunction with the karma that influences the mind), </p> <p>and be aware of the fact that doing right things strengthen our inner </p> <p>potential, whereas doing bad things leads us into ignorance and away from </p> <p>enlightenment by which we can free ourselves from the bondage of </p> <p>ignorance and of the influence of karma. In that case, can you point to </p> <p>any so-called religious scriptures that, according to your knowledge, could be </p> <p>beneficial for all of us, and could you point to any sort of religious environment </p> <p>(I mean Catholicism, Buddhism, Hinduism, for example, along with their 'holy </p> <p>scriptures') as a poit of referrence (for truth) in the spiritual path? </p> <p>This has been quite a long question and it may appear too complicated, so once </p> <p>again : what , according to you, is the spiritual condition of humankind today after </p> <p>already more than two thousand years of Christianity, after almost three thousand </p> <p>years since the Buddha Gautama tought of his enlightenment, after around thirteen/ </p> <p>fourteen (depends on how we calculate the this period) centuries since Mohammed, </p> <p>the messenger of Allah, revealed Koran ( by the way, what is your thinking in this </p> <p>subject_who was Koran revealed by?), and so on. </p> <p>There are many spiritual teachers who constantly want their disciples to repeat </p> <p>various mantras as a means of liberating the selfs from their karma and a means of </p> <p>reunion (yoga, communion) with the Supreme God. ( At this point I would like to </p> <p>ask you to clarify to me your understanding of God, if this is not a trouble to you, </p> <p>of course).

Born in the Southern Tip of Africa in the 1980's. By Birth I am a South African, currently I stay in Johannesburg. Native South African.</p> <p>As I am, I feel alone and distant from the everyday activities of life, I am void of the normal activities of humanity. </p> <p>My search for something beyond the ordinary began when I came across the book named the Holy Bible, I read it page to page, I labored upon its ancient writing, words spoken and the meaning of such words obscured and hidden to the naked eye. </p> <p>Then I looked for someone, anyone who could interpret this words, I was saddened to discover that thousands and thousands of years later mankind has not awaken to their slumber. It is not an understanding of the world that I am after, for those that belong and are of this world let them be concerned of this world. I am not of this world, that I am I know, I might be in this world. Experience this world, go through this world. Yet there is something deep within me that reminds me that I am not of this world. </p> <p>This world is not enough for me, I much beyond and above all I see, this is not a belief, this is not a faith nor is it religion. Understand me at this point and if you do, then you will realize that you and I need not converse about matters of this world.

If we have a chance to contact I want to listen from you about your problem.

No one needs to be proving any written work of any religion, for it is pointless and leads us away and keeps us away. </p> <p>You've have laid it out in your question to my question, what I have been seeking is that opening of the eye, how do I open my eye? </p> <p>And I do no know which eye you speak of and I know that once I have done this I will be separate no more, I will be one, complete, whole and I will realize that I have been all this time.

My kidneys both nearly don&acute;t work. I take pills, go three times a week to hospital. However I&acute;m scared that the operation (a kidney from my mum) won&acute;t be successful. Infact the reason that I&acute;m so scared is because I saw death while I was staying in hospital in January. Then I lost my girlfriend a week after getting out of hospital. That really hurt. Then I had endless money problems and family problems, relations refused to lend myself and my mother money and so it stressed us out so much that the operation now has to be in the Autumn. I did even think about killing myself! My uncle and cousin in England said that I should move back to London which made me mad with rage. My dad said the same and for 3 months I refused to talk to my dad who lives in Z&uuml;rich, Switzerland. We are now on speaking terms. However I don&acute;t wish to have any contact with any of my relations in England apart from my mum. My mums friends have helped me with money and things are better in this point and I did manage to solve the problems even though it was very hard. It&acute;s strange but all these bad things have infact helped me to be more focused with what I want to do in my life. I&acute;m a teacher in Vienna, Austria, I want to do a Celta course and set-up a business (of which I&acute;ve always wanted to do) in Slovakia (because I can&acute;t find a job) which is only 60km away from Vienna. But I&acute;m scared to fail because so many bad things have happened to me. My mum and dad are not together and this scares me that I can never keep a girlfriend. I hate being single. I&acute;m afraid of being alone forever without a wife, friend and a lover. I find it strange that my mother doesn&acute;t mind not being with a man. I would like her to be with someone. To be with a woman that loves me has occupied my mind all my life even though now I&acute;m ill.

Does Solar Gazing help activate inner abilities?</p> <p>Thank you<br/> Ron Parrish</p> <p>Answer from Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Ron </p> <p>If you want to learn how to read you should learn from somebody who knows letters. You should pass a few courses in order to see the world like me. First of all you need to know the way to see the world. You don't have to think this too much difficult. Let's take mathematics as an example. What kind of teaching and learning can make you to create and solve the mathematical questions ? If you think this question you may find a good idea. If you don't find any idea ask me again. </p> <p>Because I do not teach meditation I don't know why people have to practice meditation. I know that there are lots of people who have experienced very dangerous things through meditation. </p> <p>You were born by the causes and occasions of the activities of the world. In short, you are a creature of the world. The world can not exist inside of you. And your effort and ability will decide how much you do understand and embrace this world. </p> <p>Who is the God and why it want to live in poor humans' body ? You might understand it if you think this issue with common sense. That is just a fable that was made by liars. And 'Heaven is within you' means that the way to the heaven is created by what is in you. </p> <p>Tathagata</p> <p>Further response from Ron</p> <p>Sir, Of course one should go to an expert in any field chosen.<br/> Truth is often simple.<br/> Can you tell me how to see as you do?<br/> Maybe describe what it is like?<br/> I sense you feel like an island<br/> I might be wrong<br/> Maybe you feel the Oneness.<br/> Connection brings Joy<br/> You do not seem joyful<br/> again, I may be wrong.<br/> Thank you for returning to assist.<br/> I find it hard to believe&quot;no one else wanted to come&quot;<br/> as you said... what are three things most important to you, sir please?<br/> Perhaps some will understand if there is more description<br/> of what we are and what we are not<br/> Thank you very much!</p> <p>Ron</p> <p>Further reply from Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Ron,</p> <p>When I see the things I see them as they are. </p> <p>People have very different points of view because they have different motae. That's why many of saints who came to the human world were killed. They should have said more carefully. But people can realise that they committed sin only after when those saints were killed. People understand what saints said were true only after their death. </p> <p>I also have spent lots of time in agony to find out a solution for the problem of difference of view between human beings and me. And finally I understood that was the evidences. People had to accept what I said was true as I showed them the perfect evidence but they looked away because they didn't like it. Good wins evil-it is right in only theory. But in reality a good person can be killed by a stronger robber.

I mean all sun and no rain makes for a dry desert. I also feel consciousness works the same way. I feel that people are in the material phase and can't understand or appreciate the deeper truths. I'm not sure but I think there is a universal knowledge, and all of these religions just small parts or basic knowledge for those who cant yet receive the truth. as an enlightened being you should understand that.

Would you consider/already believe that the world you and I live is a continuum?</p> <p>2.) Taken from an article on destiny, &quot;Even a drop of water in the largest ocean has more significant</p> <p>presence in the backdrop of that ocean than a human being has in the universe.

In history books it ultimately is a spiritual justification for Americas expansion.

I spend my whole day to study and in order to finish my appoinments I have to stay up late, which weakened my health too. But I still cannot do well so I felt very frustrated and began to skip classes and refused to do my work but indulged in leisureness and still stayed up late so my health did not improve at the cost of doing nothing constructively. And my self control seems totally lost. Last night I made up my mind to go to the lecture this morning but I slept over the time gain. So far I have skipped one week of classes in a row and homeworks were piling up but I am even not trying to get these done, thinking that is too difficult for me and giving up instead of trying to figure it out or getting help from professors and classmates.

I have come to believe we as humanity have circumvented that original plan of destruction and have entered into 'Plan B' where we are creating a new world.

They are desires for fame, power, materials, sex and likings. </p> <p>Karma means things in your past i,e, what is in the origin of your life. This karma was created by the activities in your past. It is attached to you and has influence on your life until it is vanished. It can be repeated for hundreds to thousands years from one time mistake. Whenever you come to life it comes along with you. That's why karma is the biggest obstacle to attain enlightenment. Only when you remove karma you can enter samadhi and then you can see things as they really are. How on earth is it possible to achieve enlightenment without satisfying these conditions? </p> <p>Last year during my travelling to America I visited one person as I'd heard he was enlightened. When we stayed in New York for a while we tried in many ways to have an appointment with him. Finally we succeeded so we drove the car to his place and we met his secretary , students and the editor of his magazine first. I suggested that I would like to donate all of my money if I could find that his activity was beneficial for the world. He seemed to be attracted to money. He allowed us to see him anyway. </p> <p>He walked lightly holding his dog in his arm and sat on the sofa . He looked at me with silence.&quot; I'm here to meet a guru, so I'd like to check one thing. Do you mind if I give you a question?&quot; &quot;No, I don't.&quot; </p> <p>I asked him,&quot;What is your standard for right and wrong ?&quot; He didn't answer. How is it possible for a person to enlighten somebody if he is not able to see what is right or wrong ? Then, how can he have so many followers ? Because there are the dead. </p> <p>Somebody who wants enlightenment must make self free from one's own karma. How can you disentangle the karma ? No way. As the past has passed nobody can refund it. It had existed and passed. Here we have the only way. That's love. Only through love you can burn your karma. Through love and agony. It is absolutely wrong if somebody says that you can obtain enlightenment without them. </p> <p>Nobody knows in this era what love is. That's why for enlightenment you need to meet the enlightened one first and learn the process from him and practice them as you learned. </p> <p>If you really want to be enlightened ask yourself,&quot;Am I strong in my body and spirit ?&quot; If &quot;no&quot; it is impossible to attain enlightenment in this life. That's nothing but your desire . The way to remove karma is love and agony. I teach there's no way without them .</p><p>Tathagata </p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Indu</h3> <p>Respected Tathagata</p> <p>What is the relation between karma and love ?

When will I be able to study with that teacher and what is their name? Are they Buddhist, Hindu, Native American, or other religion/culture?</p> <p>Thank-you.</p> <p>Joyce Wright</p> <p>USA</p> <p>Answer from Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Joyce,</p> <p>1. As your past life has already erased in your memory long long time ago, you do not have any evidence to prove the truth what happened in your past life. All your memory was erased in the process of your revival to this world of phenomenon. If you was a master in your past life you still have the knowledge of that time. Could you show me them? Then, I can tell you what you were... a master,a soldier or a farmer... However I can not tell you now as we are in very distance and we never ever met. </p> <p>2.The parent body of all of the lives is made from what happened in it's past. That parent body was revived and born again, which is called as life. Don't think much of your mission that came from your birth. Your real mission is to find what you really want to do and to learn how you can realise it. </p> <p>3.I've traveled lots of countries and met many people. But I could not meet any enlightened one or any one who knew about enlightenment. Although it is possible for anyone to get an enlightenment you need to pass a few process. If you want to be enlightened you should understand the courses very precisely and practice them. Then you will be able to know where is the enlightenment and how it comes to you. The best practice for your soul and life is to make yourself live with diligence, simplicity and honesty. I expect your good question. </p> <p>4.I do not have any information about you and what you do, so I don't know what you are like. Without information I can not say about your future. The things in the world is like maths. An answer is made by a question. That's why my answer about your future will only depend on your information. If someone can tell the future without this process you can believe it's a lie. </p> <p>5. I've explained it to you just before. Even though I travelled so many places in the world I failed to find any one who had the knowledge to guide humans to enlightenment. If you want enlightenment and are looking for such a guru you can meet him. </p> <p>Enlightenment means to realise what is in the world and how the things come to exist. Therefore the enlightened one can see where is good and bad and he becomes to familiar with the principle of the world. If you want you can see me anytime. If you want my knowledge you can have it anytime. But your view and mine to see the world are too far, so it's maybe a long long way for you to come to me and learn.</p> <p>Tathagata</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From LK</h3> <p>Dear Tathagata,</p> <p>I have recently adapted my thinking in the way of karma.

The problem is, I work alone after 1pm and this person is well built, rough, and always looks on drugs. </p> <p>Is it worth confrunting him and the effect it will have on me (probably being assulted) or at least alot of hassel could come as a result becasue he comes on my shifts.</p> <p>I think to myself it is only small, and it is him that is doing wrong and his own karma will catch him up, it is only maybe once a month and the company I work for is massive and the stock will not be missed.

He would not be able to steal anything else without me directly seeing him do it.</p> <p>I will be talking to my manager when he gets back in a week, it will also give me time to see what he does.</p> <p>I would just like to know if ignorance on this sort of subject will affect my karma ?</p> <p>Kind regards,</p> <p>LK</p> <p>Answer from Tathagata</p> <p>Dear LK, </p> <p>It is hard for anyone to ignore when you find somebody doing wrong. But if he is rough and somewhat dangerous it is not easy for you to advise him directly or report to the manager. I'd like to tell you one way. Why don't you make some chances so that some other people can see his action and collect their wisdom? If several people scold him or complaint together he may be changed. </p> <p>When someone worry they may have some reason. That is natural for you to worry when something wrong happens.

I used to panic at the most MINOR change in my own energy, even if it could be my stomach is full, because I had not realized it was not that.</p> <p>I could and still do talk between my past and my present. It's almost forced because neither me nor my past wish it to continue, and it is an unhappy thing. We share emotions and feelings at such a level that if my present was mad because of whatever reason, the past would react to it and assume I was mad about something, or at my past. </p> <p>I was traumatized in 2003 up until end of 2004 by my future, and when I got to around 2006, I found myself traumatizing my past, not because I wanted to, but because it was such a burden.</p> <p>I was traumatized by seeing spirits as well, due to lack of control, and not knowing when they are there and when they are not there. </p> <p>I have been heavily toyed with by spirits just because I was afraid. </p> <p>Right now, I still have the problem of continually speaking to my past whether I would like to or not.

If you have new spiritual ability you should prove that by the certain proofs about what you've seen in reality and what kind of benefit did you give to your life of other' from them.Otherwise that is not appropriate to regard as new spiritual ability.

To be enlightened is to understand not only truth, but to acknowledge the existence of un-truth and apply that knowledge to prove truth. </p> <p>Would you agree ? If so, perhaps I am well on my way to what should be the goal of every living being that may be aware of such a goal.</p> <p>If you are for some reason unfamiliar with the works of Edgar Cayce, I would strongly suggest checking him out. He is another who spoke only in truth, although I feel he held back much of what he knew - he put forth a tremendous amount of valuable information. I am assuming you would have already have had some contact with his A.R.E. I feel you could be of some significance in their regard, I'm sure you can shed light on that yourself =). </p> <p>Excuse my ignorance in regard to yourself, I have not yet read much of your site, only a few topics of which my previous thoughts have fallen upon complete vindication. </p> <p>But, back to Cayce: His &quot;doomsday&quot; predictions are not so specific... I feel on purpose. I am most familiar with his view of America, being as we are both from America. He indicates, as do you (and I agree), much devastation will come from water. I have drawn the correlation to a pole shift, even before I had any such knowledge of the poles actually shifting - the start of which in 1999 which aligns with the mayan calendar. This I believe is what brings about such earth changes, causing a great gravity shift - and from what I have read you agree. This process is upon us... it is only a matter of time before a great plate shift occurs, and the inevitable giant tsunami arises, which I doubt will be isolated... what conclusions have you come to that have not been readily published ? Cayce predicted the &quot;safe&quot; areas in the United States to be parts of Illinois/Indiana/Ohio.... It makes perfect sense, and aligns with my &quot;natural&quot; affinity for that area... in fact from my youngest years I have had a certain awareness of water &quot;coming in&quot;, although I never understood it until I recently drew that (among many other) correlation leading to the &quot;truth&quot;. Would you agree? </p> <p>Your statement of &quot;many of the worlds creatures will die&quot; does not incite one bit of fear in me... it only reminds that some will survive. Any is as good as infinity. Perhaps who survives will be those most in tune with the truth of nature, they will naturally go where it is safe... I think you have hinted at that through the discussion of destiny. Just as animals fly away from an impending hurricane, it will be those who listen to nature instead of fighting nature. I have never understood why people build a house that will undoubtedly be destroyed by nature, and then are upset at the sight of its destruction... such is the human condition, such is the darkness society is built on. I see their view, I understand why they have it, but I cannot understand why they accept it and seek nothing greater. </p> <p>The purpose of this email is to open up a line of discussion so that we may both benefit... such is the way the world should work, I personally intend to help set things in that direction, and I believe it is also your goal =) </p> <p>Peace and Love</p> <p>-Mark</p> <p>Answer from Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Mark, </p> <p>Enlightenment means to see as it really is , to realise every truth.

I have done the very same thing when my third eye opened and my brain was tapping in to all the ancient secrets in the world, but it is always our actions that people react to and not only what we are teaching. I don't really understand if you see in what way the world needs to be changed. My enlightenment came in the form of a new ideology of truth that puts enlightenment at the center of society. As I see the truth, because of my western-philosophical background is similar to the philosophy of Hegel if you are familiar with his teachings. The truth is the absolute and we have catagorized our dealing with truth as three parts and those are philosophy, religion and art. These are all the same and if seen as a whole reveals the truth which it took month for my brain to understand completely. I have also been trying to speak to people about this because I suffer with all of the creation. The world is sleeping and it is time to wake it up and I don't want it to move slowly because then the mad forces of this world might kill everything off before that would happen. Right now I am sort of lonely because of the fact that I can not be open with my fellow man if I want them to stay in my life, because most people are not ready to accept that they are living a big lie created by a culture that is out of control. </p> <p>So my view upon enlightenment is that people has to step out of there cultural programming and become the supreme being they all are if they can see their greatness. </p> <p>I would love to come see you and give you &quot;proof&quot; that I really am enlightend and I would also know if you really are enlightend because if you are; it would be such a relief to meet someone who really understands what is going on and to start making plans to save this poor planet and this poor humanity from self-destruction. </p> <p>If you don't mind me saying it I have a hard time with language because it is so limiting.

I look at the world and thing around me dont seem to have any defined edges its as though everything around me is merged together in some way I decided to seek some alternative medicines as all doctors wanted to do was to load me up with pills was seeing an Indian lady who practiced kinsieology and she discovered that I had high levels of sprituality, astro projection do you think that I have started a kind of path to enlightenment or am I just going crazy</p> <p>I would appreciate your thoughts</p> <p>Many Thanks</p> <p>Andy</p> <p>Answer From Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Andy,</p> <p>I realized you are in a very hard situation by your e-mail. Even though you take pills, they don't cure your problem. First of all, you need to know a cause for curing the sickness. Other soul's activity is starting inside of you. That's why your consciousness may divide from your body sometimes. You should regard this happening as quite bad. What the Indian woman said has no evidence and it is just talking about spiritual world. So, it's not a quite worthy thing. You are not starting Enlightenment. In the result, you just got a handicap that makes you feel uncomfortable in an ordinary life. The way to cure it is simple but I'm far away from you and I can not help you right now.

It's not my personal e-mail but the e-mail is owned by people who is helping my work. For a moment, whenever you send it to the address, I can receive your mail. If you ask about Christianity, any Christian can not explain about that. At the beginning, they didn't create the religion for informing what is but for informing a myth which they created. Because of that, in their teaching, there is no problem and no answer. Therefore, they tell you any answers are God's will and if some problem appears, they just say it's God's will. However, whenever they have a fault, they support God. So, without God, they can not answer anything. That is their position. If you are lucky enough to be free from a temptation of Christianity, it's a big blessing for yourself but I don't know until when you can protect yourself from a temptation of the world without the Enlightenment.

This is the first time I write to you. I studied your website and found it very enlightening. I have no right to judge anybody and I do not need to judge you because the only one who is guiding my spiritual life is God. God never sends me to a wrong spot. He always guides me to proper issues. I learned about &quot;life&quot; , &quot;destiny&quot; and &quot;karma&quot; through your writing and I realized the importance of cooperation with spiritual leaders, but I could not understand <u>what is your main message for people</u>. What is the main point that I should pay attention to? </p> <p>Dear Tathagata perhaps you know about Suprememaster.tv. It is a global television channel owned and managed by enlightened Guru Ching Hai. </p> <p>This TV channel is accessible all over the world through the satellite and internet. Master Ching Hai is warning about the very serious danger of global warming that can lead to disappear the whole of living existence on the Earth by the year 2012. In order to save the planet Earth Mster Ching Hai is inviting people to vegetarian diet, meditation, prayers, no killing, and a virtuousness way of living so that the karma of the planet will decrease. </p> <p>I think both of you are working on a same goal : saving planet Earth. </p> <p>I am in cooperation with this TV channel in some way. I thing it is a good idea that people all over the world receive your valuable teaching through this TV channel. </p> <p>I plan to ask Master Ching Hai to produce more effective TV programs by announcing your teaching as well. But I don't know &mdash; Dear Tathagata &mdash; what is your idea about your cooperation with this TV. </p> <p>I am waiting for hearing from you. </p> <p>Thank you very much. </p> <p>Yours sincerely </p> <p>Majid Nadalizadeh</p> <p>Answer from Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Majid,</p> <p>The other day, I met your master Ching Hai. But your master never talked much to me. I tried to make your master realize and your master gave me heart-warming hospitality. However, I failed to make her realize. What your master teaches is nothing particular to let people recognize things in the reality and she conveys almost spiritual teachings to people. What I can explain to you clearly is if you don't open your eye by yourself, you can not bless the world with only the spiritual teaching and the one who can not bless the world can not bless anyone. This point is the difference between my teaching and your master's teaching. If I show up on TV and reveal the world of Enlightenment then your master is going to have nothing to do. Why? Because she is not an enlightened being, she has a spiritual master and the same condition as an ordinary person who receives guidance from a spiritual master and a normal person and various kinds of people who insist they have attained Enlightenment. My condition is different. This different point can not match well. Your master told me that she liked to learn from me one day but more than 10 years later she never came to me and said hello to me so far. If you want to know about this indeed, you can verify this immediately when you bring me to your master. And we can verify that if I ask things in the reality, no one can answer my simple question in this world.

I have been training in Rinzai Zen since 1998. I am a senior student and ours is a lineage that dates back 2500 years to the Buddha. I feel very fortunate to have found my &quot;karmic&quot; home so to say.</p> <p>No offense, but in what I read on your website you act as if you are the only one out there who has had their third eye open. For some reason I highly doubt that to be the case. I read and understand very well where you are coming from. I too have gone through deep experiences and know that this training NEVER ends. It goes from one life to the next...we live in some form or another for as long as the Universe allows itself to exist.</p> <p>The world needs more people like you though...it really does. In fact that is one of the things that comes to me that is from the True Self--that more Spiritual Teachers need to get out there more and share their experiences more with the world in order to &quot;wake everybody up.&quot; It is to bad that you have not been able to lecture here in the United States.

Rutkowski</p> <p>Answer from Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Matthew,</p> <p>By making contact with gods and dead souls, the spiritual master whom you are talking about tells people about what living people can not see. And the difference between a spiritual master and me is what I'm informing to people. I don't get any information from a dead being and I let people know what I saw by myself and what is in reality. Therefore, I suggest the way that people can make themselves realize through what I inform them. That's why, a spiritual teaching taught from making contact with dead souls is not helpful and is not a blessing for Enlightenment and future yourself. And to make people realize by one's experience and observation gives benefit to the teacher and learner in the future and present. It means both the teacher and learner receive a very good result.

He said he could feel every one who was within many many meters of distance. He asked me if I wanted to learn something. I said yes. He grabbed my arm realy hard (it hurt) and then opened his eyes really wide and said &quot;listen&quot;. He then opened his mouth (unimaginable giants voice, as big as a mountain, or the universe) and I was surrounder by om, I almost made water in my pants and tried to pull away but the om was all knowing I felt it's wisdom, and I knew I could not hide anywhere.

I let go of all things including fear of death and concepts of anything iincluding love, hate enlightenment etc... and then something happened to me, I was in a natural state for 3 days.

But it's a shame that I can not explain each of the contents that you sent me because there is too big a difference between what I see in the world and what you see in the world. If your master showed that to you, ask him if he can also show that thing to me. And if he can show me that, he will be a great person. However, let me tell you one thing, he is still a blind person, so he can show incomprehensible and mysterious things to people but it's hard for him to recognize things in reality. Therefore, you need to see that I debate something with him and what I ask him and what I answer to his question. If you want this, I can fly to America or India or everywhere and anytime for you. If you are wondering this, first, I want to inform you about a very important thing, which is that that we should judge something by a fact rather than by our imagination. And we never deny that everything in reality is true. I'm very curious as to which mysterious power he has. I feel very interesting if the mysterious power can affect even me. So far, I've never seen anyone that can wield me their mysterious power and whenever I visit someone who declares themselves as an enlightened being on my world travels, I've never met even one person who can recognize what I point out about things in reality.

What would you advise?</p> <p>Thank you for maintaining your site, I continue to find it very helpful.</p> <p>Simon</p> <p>Answer from Tathagata,</p> <p>Dear Simon,</p> <p>For answering your question, first, I have to understand accuracy of the problem. But your explanation is very obscure. So, when I have a detailed information and indication of the problem, I can answer you which thing is good or bad for you to help your friend or not to do. Because, in many cases, each people's Motae which they had when they were born is different, it's easy to have a trouble with mutual understanding. We can see these cases everywhere easily that people feel trouble with the others who have different Motae. And you may have the same experience. Therefore, for more understanding of exact things in reality, your question should be detailed for helping me to recognize the problem. If you tell me in every particular, I believe that I can answer you exactly.</p> <p>Tathagata</p> <p>Further reply from Simon</p> <p>Dear Tathagata,</p> <p>Thank you for your reply. I was obscure in explaining the problem, because the situation is quite difficult for me. I will do my best to describe in detail.</p> <p>The girl I spoke about has had a 'crush' on me for some time now. Last year, about a month after we met, she told me she liked me in this way, that she wanted to be my girlfriend. I did not feel quite the same way, but told her that I would think about it. I never really gave her an honest answer, but we continued to see each other as friends.</p> <p>I then started seeing another girl, who became my girlfriend. When my friend found out about this (from another mutual friend), she got very upset, because I hadn't told her about my girlfriend, thinking I could spare her feelings. I know that it would have been better to be honest with her straight away. I apologized, and we remained friends. When it eventually became clear that she still felt strongly about me, I explained to her that I didn't feel that way about her, and that she should find somebody else.</p> <p>My problem now is that I still sense that she feels that way about me. This affects me, because I worry that I am still leading her on by remaining friends with her, and I worry that she still gets upset because of my actions. I enjoy her company and friendship, but I feel that she wants more from me than I am prepared to give.</p> <p>I hope this is somewhat clearer.</p> <p>Simon</p> <p>Further reply from Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Simon,</p> <p>Because each person's thinking, mind and feelings can be different, then the girl doesn't feel the same as you and she becomes confrontational and emotional when trying understand you. We can see this kind of case from several examples. First, it may occur from the girl's consciousness. Second, when her consciousness has a problem or some problems are occurred by another spirit, this situation may happen. When someone accepts another spirit, and a problem occurs, then sometimes they develop a feeling which is a kind of anger or they can not control one's emotion and judgment. If possible then you need to meet her as little as possible and if you don't have any affinity with her then don't meet her at all and tell her frankly that you don't know why she thinks of you in this way and you are sorry that this happened. And you must speak honestly and don't mince your words.</p> <p>Tathagata</p> <p>Further response from Simon</p> <p>Dear Tathagata,</p> <p>Thank you for your reply. Your advice and answers have always been helpful to me. Now I am looking for a way to improve my own ability to solve my problems, to 'awaken' myself, as you call it. Of course, it is useful to send you my questions and problems like this; however, because of the time I must spend waiting for your reply, it would be a good thing if I could find a way to help myself as well. </p> <p>My plan is to spend time each week writing a document of problems that I notice in my life, and then use the things I have learned from you and your website to try and explain how the problem was created, what parts make up the problem, and what the solution could be. </p> <p>To sum up my problem this time: I would like to learn a method of helping myself see the world more clearly and solve problems, but I have not yet found a method that works. Do you think my plan is a good idea? If not, could you suggest a different method I can use regularly to help myself?</p> <p>Thank you for your time,</p> <p>Simon</p> <p>Further answer from Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Simon,</p> <p>I'm deliberating how I should answer your question. Teaching always exists inside us but people don't recognize that and which thing exists and whether which thing is helpful for themselves or not. So, they need a guide such as me. From what we can see in mathematics, there are very many numbers from one to a hundred trillion. If we look truth teaching that can be helpful for our life, there are also very many things in various fields as mathematics.

I haven't received such a good question for a long time. You may have difficulty to understand me. It's impossible for anyone to easily accept and understand my ability and my words because even though the chance to be born as an enlightened being in the world happens about once in every three thousand years, but in my case I've already had the superior enlightenment in my Motae tens of thousands of years ago. What I can speak to people is to teach people what I see in things in the world and to explain to people how important my teaching is for them. Then, what is the difference between what I teach and what the others teach ?</p> <p>The others make words and read books and explain what they've read from books and what they don't know as if they know about the contents of the books. But I don't make words and read books. My teachings is to explain the problems that people should know and how people can recognize the problems and how my teaching can be helpful for making themselves realize. I explain to people such examples. Then, how about the others' teaching. Now almost all people who lead many people have a spiritual master and what the spiritual master teaches doesn't have a problem and they miss how the problem becomes some result through some example. </p> <p>This point is the difference between my teaching and the others'. And the more people are ignorant then the more they like the illusionary word. That's why, anyone can accept easily untrue words but an enlightened being, in my case, absolutely never speaks illusionary words. I see what is and explain what will happen in the future and explain how things in the world exist, but I explain in detail the cause and matter in the process and result.

You said you practiced Buddha's teaching. I've met many intellectual but I've never met any Buddha's teaching anywhere in the world. Then where is the Buddha's teaching that you've got ? Did you heard them directly from Buddha or others ? I like to ask about that. Secondly, you said you practiced Buddha's teaching and from what I can see there is no one who knows Buddha's teaching but how can you practice it by yourself ? Third, in the case of you attained Enlightenment, then you don't need to follow and sell other's teaching or Buddha's teaching because you observe by yourself and inform what you saw to others. But you didn't attain Enlightenment for sure and I think you don't know any information on how to attain Enlightenment. You have to explain how you have such ability of the Enlightenment through some method but you didn't explain anything about that. So, I have to say like this. And through Enlightenment, people practice the way of Buddha and our society is supposed to be the only place to teach the necessary way for practicing the way of Buddha. Therefore, I wonder about where and how you learned it. And if you are born with them because of your virtue in the past, you should be a very superior person all around you and you should show many marvel to people so far. Your business can be best of the business circles but I couldn't read that you worked for some business with your ability and then you were the best of the business circles in short time. I see various conditions, I like to tell you that you couldn't wake yourself up from illusion and if you don't want to listen what I tell you, I like to ask this. In the world, there are many words but when you execute some word, the definition of the word should exist. If you attained Enlightenment and you send me what is the definition of the Enlightenment next time, I will verify things in what you tell me. Then, if I verify whether you can see, what I point out from what you say, the identity in yourself will be exposed.</p> <p>Tathagata</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Joe</h3> <p>Dear Tathagata,</p> <p>Hello,</p> <p>Is it possible for me to meet Tathagata to learn from him in person?</p> <p>Could Tathagata guide me to enlightenment?</p> <p>Where is Tathagata visiting next?

Your picture depicts a man who seems completely at peace, what you speak is profound, and after reading your biography, your enlightenment does seem completely logical, as only a truly extraordinary person could encounter and counteract such circumstances.</p> <p>I would like to ask one question though, without trying to sound too pedantic. Buddhist monks, since Siddharta's enlightenment, are only in possession of one or two items of clothing, significantly a robe. Without trying to sound materialistic, why is it that you don seemingly expensive suits. I know this is a crazy question to ask, but in some ways, only from what I have read, it does some quite ironic for a man of your position. I'm not in any way denouncing you but I would be intrigued at your answer.</p> <p>I have another question as well regarding your views on the end of the world. I can understand that you must have an enormous burden to carry as you can envision the truth behind it, and im not even expecting an answer back to this question due to the secrecy you hold behind it, but I was just wondering if it has anything to do with the Mayan 2012 prophecy. From the way I perceive things, although it may only be because I have only been more intricately aware of the worlds problems recently, I do sense that things are getting worse (although again I may be wrong). 3rd world countries are deteriorating before our eyes, governments continue to lie and ignore their countries although people are now figuring out these corruptions due to liberation of speech, and culture is increasingly becoming more fabricated and dillusioned, particularly in the west, where morality seems to have deteriorated much more than it has done in other parts of the world.</p> <p>I would be honored if you replied back.</p> <p>Your sincerely,</p> <p>Jason</p> <p>Answer from Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Jason,</p> <p>It's a long time since I got such a question that makes me smile. So, I appreciate your question. I bought the coat purely with my money. Therefore, there is no problem and the coat is quite high-grade goods, but I bought it at a low price because where I bought the coat was the factory of the coat. And I don't cause people's sympathy and absolutely don't look down upon people's valuables or such kind of thing through a story that I don't know the same as Buddhist monk. Although I'm always endeavoring for making people awake, I'm a freeman and a freeman can wear short pants in the summer and woolen Western clothes in the winter. Somehow, I'm very glad that you ask this kind of thing of me, I accept your question with pleasure.</p> <p>I also realize very surprising facts again though the curiousity of your question about the end of the world (Changing period). Everything in the world is repeating in single periodic time, and someone in the history of the Maya said the end of the world will occur in 2012 on the grounds of the periodic time theory. But if one didn't calculate accurately the basis and date in detail and at the moment one predicted with a periodic time theory three thousand or four thousand ago,then it doesn't matter if one knew what one predicted, anyway we can not verify it now but it's predicted very accurately. However, the reason that I add a little time, few years, is I observe very near and one observed from further than me. Therefore, a difference of a few years can exist. The end of the world will occur between 2017 and 2020 in the world. And secondly, why western people are morally ruined is that there are too many things that ordinary people can't understand in the world. So, I'm considering deeply what is good for explaining such matters. We call the consciousness which left from the living body as a ghost. Because this ghost separates from a living body, it doesn't have a body. If a ghost enter a human's body, then they can change the human's character and they show will to fulfill their own corrupted desires and wants and such things. The cause is dead being doesn't enter metempsychosis and therefore exists with having consciousness as a living state. As time goes by, it's getting worse.</p> <p>Tathagata</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<h3>Enlightenment Questions - Question From Arvind</h3> <p>Dear Tathagata,</p> <p>Do you believe in God.Can you tell whether Jesus , Gautam Buddha , Mohammad were enlightened. </p> <p>How you are going to help ordinary people like us, as you say that no one can achieve the state of enlightenment.</p> <p>Thanks </p> <p>Arvind</p> <p>Answer from Tathagata</p> <p>Dear Arvind,</p> <p>When we ask someone that you believe in God, we have to clarify which point of god we believe in.

I can not agree that Jesus and Mohammad attained Enlightenment because there are no such evidences through them. </p> <p>If there is one thing that I make you realize, I let you see some instance and your consciousness can awake through the instance.

The reason why Tathagata came to the world is to reveal truth which was in ourselves and he made his life endlessly in vain by doing this.</p> <p>He was born on 04.06.1942 in a place called Anu Cave, Yang Bo Myeun, Hadong Gun, Kyeong Song Do very deep in the mountains in South Korea, where apart from his family, no other people lived around for miles. There were seven members of His family and they all had to sleep in the same small room. Having a new member of the family was not a good thing at the time as his family were very poor and they did not even have any land to farm. As they were so poor baby Tathagata was fed on soup made from the roots of plants and the bark of trees from the very first day he was born. His father was ill and bedridden and his young brothers and sisters had to wander around the mountains to look for food. Under the circumstances he was a burden for his family because he cried unusually loud from the day he was born. Because he cried so loud many times from the day he was born his father threw him against the ground many times and sometimes he was left in the mountains alone where wild animals roamed.</p> <p>When he was only one year old his father died along with both his brothers in the same year. Since this happened young Tathagata was made to stay alone all day and when his exhausted family returned home from the long trek to and from work Tathagata was ignored and not shown any affection. This soon ended because when Tathagata was nine years old his mother also died. Since then nobody wanted to take responsibility for him or look after him so he had to leave the mountains and catch a bus to the city where he had never been before to search for relatives. But his relatives did not have enough money to look after him, so soon after young Tathagata had to take responsibility of his own life and had to do hard labour work continuously. As he was a child, this gave him searing body ache all night. When he couldn't find such work he had to go out into the streets searching for any work. Malnourished and overworked and with a weak body Tathagata had to endure these terrible conditions until his late teens.</p> <p>Finally he could be free from these terrible conditions when he was seventeen years old the government allowed him to join the army as a teenage soldier, so for a short time he was free from his ordeal. Through his life in the army he became a confident young man and everyone around him felt a good feeling by seeing his confidence. Tathagata's life in the army was like a dream in comparison with his previous hard life, but he could not let himself stay in the army continuously so when he was twenty three years old he came back to civilian life. Since then he started to have a dream in his heart to become a messenger of the public. By the age of twenty five he had entered into politics, he stated his political views magnificently and he also started to point out and criticize what was wrong with the social situation at that time. By doing this he could attract people's attention and as a result of this he became under surveillance from those in power.</p> <p>When he was thirty three years old he met his wife and got married and after his son and daughter were born he started a business from nothing to look after his family who were dependent on him. Within three years he had proved his ability as the best in his business. But his destiny which he was holding meant that there was no place where he could settle down. When he saw people around him he had to be cautious and tactful to authority because the situation at that time meant nobody could stand up to authority or speak their minds. Because of this it was then that he had to give up his dream that he had.</p> <p>From that moment on and for the next six years he spent his time drinking alcohol and worrying about the future of the nation.</p> <p>In 1983 he wrote his autobiography, and one year later on the 10th November 1984 he left his home and stayed on a small island off the south called Yeon Hwado, which translated into English means Lotus Island. One day he questioned himself and at that time something came up in his brain. At that moment he realized that to know his secret he had to go back to the world before he was born. Since that happened he saw himself as someone who had attained the Enlightenment that nobody could attain for a long time. The Enlightenment what he has at the moment exists in himself and this Enlightenment was completed by himself several thousand years ago.</p> <p>The Way of the Enlightened Being</p> <p>When Tathagata opened his eyes to his Enlightenment he introduced himself through this poem.</p> <p>I am a traveller<br/>A traveller who has a burden<br/>Gloriously shining<br/>A traveller who has a treasure burden</p> <p>I am a traveller<br/>A traveller who has a burden<br/>Who is lonely and looking for a friend<br/>A traveller who has a treasure burden</p> <p>I am a traveller<br/>A traveller who has a burden<br/>Wondering in darkness<br/>A traveller who has a treasure burden</p> <p>I am a traveller<br/>A traveller who has a burden<br/>Who came to the world<br/>A traveller looking for a lord</p> <p>Soon after his Enlightenment he received a message from very far away, the message was like this :-<br/>\\\"When you know the truth you will be lonely and when you tell the truth you will be cursed.\\\" He doesn't know why at that moment he felt such a huge inspiration from his heart. The message was revealed in reality very soon and soon after he had to undergo an ordeal which nobody could experience.</p> <p>Whenever he started to talk to people they would run away from him quickly, other people were hostile towards him and even laughed and mocked him because they thought he was crazy, people he knew ignored him and his friends did not want to see him anymore. The first thing he had to face since his Enlightenment was that he had to stand before never ending despair. If it was like the old days then he could just get drunk and try to forget everything, but since his Enlightenment he was not tempted to drink at all.</p> <p>On some days he would go out to the bus stop, but when the bus actually came he realized that he didn't have anywhere to go so he had to go back home, even so this happened continuously.</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<h3>Tathagata's love for Mankind and New Ordeals that came from his Enlightenment.</h3> <p>Tathagata had never ever been interested in the word Enlightenment until he became forty-two years old. He started to stay in a small island called Yeon-hwa-do (lotus island) since 13th of October 1984. He did not specially know someone in the island. His house was by the valley half way up the big mountain. There were two or three houses around his house but when there were no people coming in and out he felt no human traces all day. After about one month later since he started to stay there, it was nearly at the end of November. It was very windy outside and he felt especially tranquility inside room that day.</p> <p>Suddenly Tathagata had this thinking came across from inside himself at that moment. Who am ? And then the self gave him the answer, You will know that when you go over the state of \\\"ip sin\\\". He asked to himself again. Then, how can I enter the state of \\\"ip sin\\\" ? The answer came from himself this time again. Go back to the world before birth. So he started to count numbers, laid himself in the room and closed his eyes as he was directed by himself, 42, 41, 40, 39 and at the very moment when he finished to count the last one he could see the empty space where there was nothing exist. Soon after, he came back to everyday life. Since this happened there came tremendous changes to him. He did not feel bored even though he stayed in the room for several days and the idea of complicated things of the world did not occur to him.</p> <p>His mind was always calm when the days he stayed alone. And sometimes when he thought or when he saw things that exist he became to recognize the questions that the existing things have. And when he saw the questions he became to know easily what were in the questions. From this time whenever he was conscious of something, his queries in his consciousness were being solved straightaway. After this experience, he knew who he was and he could understand why he had a different life from others.</p> <p>Tathagata received messages twice from the sky since his enlightenment. At the very moment when he was deeply impressed, as if his heart seemed to burst, these words conveyed to him through his heart. The first message let him know that the world could be saved by conscience, justice and love. And the second message told him that someone who knew the Truth would become lonely and if someone spoke the Truth one would be cursed. He went back to his family after he stayed in Yeon-Hwa-Do (lotus island) for two years. But from this time he had to face things that he could not understand.</p> <p>When he met people around him, they tried to avoid him and when he tried to tell things in truth, most of them ridiculed or argued with him. He could not say his words easily because of this. So he went out to look for strangers but most of them were not different from people who he saw around him. He had to have a new anguish from this time. When the day came he had nowhere to go and as the night went darker he had to stay up thinking all sorts over. And the same thing repeated innumerably.</p> <p>From April in 1988 he started to travel abroad and he went to Japan alone without any companion. He knew no one in Japan at that time as well as there was nobody who could help him. Once he arrived in Japan there were many things that bothered him. Neither could he communicate nor read and write foreign languages, so he could not even ask the way. When he came out of his accommodation he measured a certain object by eye so that he could find his place. When he found an appropriate place as he walked along the road he put his message on the ground that he prepared by himself and let passing people see it. But it was not allowed for a long time in any place. Policemen came straightaway as if they knew, then he had to explain what he was doing by using body languages and left the place to a different place.</p> <p>Eventually he had to find a Korean who he had to pay as an interpreter. At last, he found an interpreter so he visited newspaper publishers and broadcasting stations in the city and kept after them for an opportunity to prove his words and truth. It was about 15 days later since he had arrived in Japan. One day when he left his room for a few minutes leaving his belongings he was burgled and all his money that he had was taken. He was in the situation where he could not stay any longer in such a place where he could not communicate and it even became difficult for him to return his country.</p> <p>October in the same year, Tathagata went to travel with a companion. At first, he met Prayan Seong Bon, the teacher of the King of Thailand, and Tathagata explained to him the difference between the teaching of Buddha and the teaching of modern Buddhism. Secondly, he preached about the principle which let things of the world exist in the Dhammasatan in Chulalongchon University, the best university in Thailand. Thirdly, he introduced things that exist in individuals with the subject of the world of Enlightenment in Chulabhuratan Buddhist monks school in Bangkok. And he tried to enter India through Nepal but he had to come back from the border line. In 1989, he left for India again.</p> <p>The first place where he delivered his teaching was the estate of J.P. Vaswani, one of the ten famous gurus in India, who was living in Pune. Vaswani, who invited Tathagata after reading Tathagata's message, asked Tathagata, \\\"How could you recognize who is Enlightened or who is not?\\\" Tathagata answered, \\\"When I see what is I can find out immediately whether they are enlightened or not\\\". As soon as Vaswani heard that he changed his attitude and paid respect, \\\"You are the one who truly is Enlightened\\\" he said. The next day he went to Pune University by the invitation of the vice chancellor, Dr. Kupte. Kupte asked, \\\"Could you tell me where my soul is ?\\\" Tathagata answered when he heard Kupte's question, \\\"A bean produces a bean plant and a bean plant produces beans. Your soul is placed within yourself and you produce your soul through what you do. And you will be reborn through your soul after your death.\\\" Kupte said when he listened to Tathagata, \\\"Many people amongst us put a lot of effort in order to know that but none of us could find out.\\\" When Tathagata left Pune he went to Delhi. He received an invitation from Dr. Agwani, the vice chancellor of Nehru University, through people who delivered Tathagata's message. When Agwani saw Tathagata he asked this question at first, \\\"How are you being treated in your country?\\\" When Tathagata heard that he started to laugh and he said, \\\"I am the person who is not even treated well from my wife at home.\\\" As if Agwani solved his curiosity he said like this with respectable attitude, \\\"You are a truthful person. And I believe your Enlightenment.\\\" Tathagata saw many things while he was travelling the world. And he has travelled abroad several tens of times and he has taught things in truth throughout hundreds of lectures and individual meetings. But no one could recognise what he was doing and no one wanted to know things that exist in themselves. He continues his lonely travels in order to prevent the destruction of human world only with his own ability.</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<p>Tathagata, the reincarnation of Buddha, made himself to be born among people who had the most difficult life in the world. And he made himself to be taught and learned by things that exist in him, he found out the greatest Enlightenment in himself which nobody could achieve through tens of thousands years time.<br/>Tathagata was born in 21st February 1942 (lunar calendar) in a country called Chosun (old name of Korea) which was located in east part of Asia. His house was in the mountain which was far away from the village and he had three brothers and one sister, all of them were under 10 years old at that time.</p> <p>His father was in a situation that he could not even look after himself because of his long-term illness and his mother had to look after her family's life from a situation that there were no grounds ready for living.<br/>From the very day of his birth Tathagata had to get fed with boiled water of root of trees and wild edible greens for his hunger and a few days after he was born he was thrown outside the door several times by his father and in more severe case he had been abandoned in the mountains. One year after he was born he lost his father through death and his two older brothers also died from starvation. After this happened his mother left the house in the mountain and moved to a small house in a nearby village, Bak seok gol. From that time he had to be left alone in the house during the day. His mother came home after she worked in the village everyday without missing even one day as well as his older sister who was living together did not stay home during the day time. Tathagata spent his childhood without receiving any affection by anyone because of the situation at home.</p> <p>When Tathagata was nine years old his mother died from a disease as she had gone through many difficulties from two wars and three years of bad harvest after she had Tathagata and left young Tathagata alone. Since his mother died Tathagata had nobody to depend on any more.</p> <p>When he became eleven years old the house that his mother left had gone to someone else's hand and there was nobody who wanted to help him in such a situation. So he had to leave his village alone at very young age. He visited his relatives house in a city for the first time. But their circumstances were also too bad for young Tathagata to stay for a long time. When the night came there was no place in a room for him and when the day came he felt uncomfortable to show his pitiful self. So he had to leave there one day or another and he had to wonder through strange streets because of that. From that moment he made himself to learn the method of living without bothering others. At first, when he saw a carter with a heavy load having difficulty because the carter could not go up the steep hill, he pushed from the behind all the way and helped the carter's work. Then he bought some newspapers and sold them with the money he got from the carter for bread and he had to overcome all the trials by himself from that moment.</p> <p>When he was hungry he had to drink underground water out of a pump in the street until he was full and sometimes he had to solve his hunger by eating shells and muscles that he caught from an isolated seaside where nobody was around. He had to do any job in order to escape from his hunger. Even though when he was suffering from searing pains and pulling pains in all of his body because of continuously engaging heavy labour but he had to continue the same work again the next day. Later he wrote about this in his autobiography like this, \\\"I thought nothing at that time but my only dream was that I wanted to become an adult quickly so that I could feed myself enough by my own ability. He had to spend such a long day after day because of his situation until his age reached seventeen. When he was seventeen years old he could join the army. He was discharged from the service when he became a healthy and energetic young man from the six years of army life. What he wanted to do at that time was becoming a good politician, so he established a political party and tried to contact people around him in order to accomplish his intention. At last he could stand before public together with other candidates in dignified manner at 26 years age.</p> <p>He became familiar with many people very soon by his healthy physique, smart appearance and good communication skills and he made a legendary story of himself through these by himself. He never ever compromised with injustice in any cases nor did things which would damage others in all his life. But people were not willing to give an opportunity to someone like him so that he could do service for his country. Not even less than one year since his name became known, tremendous incidents happened in the society where he was living and people who had political power proclaimed law by exercising government power to indiscriminately suppress people with conscience and justice. He saw his political party being dissolved and people around him were sent to prison. He had been put under surveillance and he felt lonely when he saw people feeling fear because they might be damaged when they became close to him.</p> <p>For the first time he felt a dependent mind on someone at that time and took this opportunity when he met his wife and got married on 13th of May in 1973. When he and his wife had a son and a daughter he could not place responsibility on his wife for their living any more. He needed income but he could not find a job, so he set up a business by himself. His business, which he started with his bare hands, succeeded to produce the best income among the same line of businesses within a year. People around him started to talk about him with pleasure when this happened and taking this opportunity he started to attract public attention again. So he could not ignore his conscience even though he was under all sorts of bad conditions. In October 1978 he warned the public like this, \\\"An answer is in the question. We should not place the future of this country on people who hide problems. Politics do not exist for people who have wealth, an academic clique and dignity. They believe that everything will be solved because they shut our mouth, ears and eyes but it will only bring about the destruction of our country.\\\"</p> <p>After the election his words became the cause to explode. He had to sufferer by government power several times and when he knew that a conspiracy was creating in order to arrest him, he gave up all his activities by himself. At that time Tathagata was thirty-six years old and he did not want to be concerned with the reality of the country any more since he had noticed that his country tried to kill him.</p> <p>He turned to alcohol in order to forget things of the world but people around him, who knew him, felt sorry for his ability. When he was forty years old he started to write sitting in his house in order to arrange his life. When his autobiography was published in 1983 he looked for a solitary island and a mountain for a while. From this time he was thinking that he had to leave for his new life to somewhere.</p> <p style=font-size:18px>Travel of Reincarnated Buddha</p> <p>Mr. Sam Han Lee who was born in Korea says himself he is Tathagata who has reincarnated from Buddha.<br/>He is 64 years old and he says that there was the Supreme Enlightenment in 1984 and that he has been continuously travelling his lonely travels in order to prevent the destruction of human world.</p> <p>He has been to about twenty countries up to now such as USA, Japan, Britain, France, Holland, Hungary, Germany, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Ethiopia, Kenya, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Czech, Slovakia, Austria and Uganda and he is planning to visit all the countries in the world from now on.</p> <p>Through his written message he let people to know the contents as below.</p> <p>I say that I am a truthful person.<br/>I came to the world to save mankind and I continue my lonely travels to<br/>prevent the destruction of the human world.<br/>I can solve the problems in the world, which nobody has been able to recognize until now and I can reveal the secrets which exist in the world of life.<br/>I can recognize the true colour of gods which appear in the human world and the problems which is caused by them.<br/>I know the truth about the end of the world which has been passed down that<br/>it will happen in this age.<br/>I can reveal the true nature of destiny and I can help people, who want a good life, to change their problems in themselves.<br/>I can confirm easily the symptoms which are difficult to be traced by modern medical technology and I can introduce the information about medicine of next generation which makes it possible to recover in a short period of time from a state that is difficult to be cured because of deterioration of the function of the body.<br/>I ask for your personal confirmation about the contents of this message and I appeal for your participation in the work of saving yourself and mankind.</p> <p>He says that the purpose of his travel is to reveal things in problems that individual human beings have.

who awakes the world) </p> <p> </p> <p>What is the difference between the world which awakes and the world which does not awake? </p> <p>&gt; It is the difference between seeing with their eyes open and with their eyes closed. </p> <p> </p> <p>What is the difference between the one able to see and the one unable? </p> <p>&gt; It is the truth. </p> <p> </p> <p>Where does truth exist? </p> <p>&gt; It is in the fact. </p> <p> </p> <p>Are you an enlightened being? </p> <p>&gt; Yes, I am. </p> <p> </p> <p>What is the proof that you are enlightened? </p> <p>&gt; The proof is in my mind. </p> <p> </p> <p>What is your mind like? </p> <p>&gt; It is the mind that sees a fact. </p> <p> </p> <p>Where is the fact? </p> <p>&gt; Anywhere. </p> <p> </p> <p>Do you call yourself an enlightened being and a tathagata? </p> <p>&gt; Yes. </p> <p> </p> <p>How did you know that you were a tathagata? </p> <p>&gt; It is because I was also a tathagata in the past. </p> <p> </p> <p>What is the proof that you were a thatagata in the past? </p> <p>&gt; It is the present. </p> <p> </p> <p>If so do you know what you are like in the future? </p> <p>&gt; Yes. </p> <p> </p> <p>By what can you prove the past and by what can you prove the future? </p> <p>&gt; It is the present. </p> <p> </p> <p>What do you mean by the present? </p> <p>&gt; It means that the present came from the past and the future comes from the present. </p> <p> </p> <p>If so how do we know such things? </p> <p>&gt; You get to know that by seeing the world. </p> <p> </p> <p>Do you see the world? </p> <p>&gt; Yes. </p> <p> </p> <p>What do you see in the world? </p> <p>&gt; It is the law of cause and effect. </p> <p> </p> <p>What does the law of cause and effect explain? </p> <p>&gt; It explains 'I' and 'what exists in front of me'. </p> <p> </p> <p>What do you mean by 'I' and 'what exists in front of me'? </p> <p>&gt; 'I' means oneself and 'what exists in front of me' means the world. </p> <p> </p> <p>What is the relationship between I and the world? </p> <p>&gt; I have the cause which makes environment in the world, the world has the effect which I try to get. </p> <p> </p> <p>Do you believe that the things of the world appear by human beings and that the things of human beings appear by the world? </p> <p>&gt; Yes. </p> <p> </p> <p>Then, do you believe the existence of God? </p> <p>&gt; Yes. </p> <p> </p> <p>You call yourself an enlightened being, what is the reason that you believe the existence of God as the enlightened being? </p> <p>&gt; It is for myself. </p> <p> </p> <p>What difference do I have when I believe the existence of God or not? </p> <p>&gt; When I believe the existence of God , I can get good mind and keep it easily; when I do not believe the existence of God ,it is difficult to get good mind and keep it. </p> <p> </p> <p>What is the good mind like? </p> <p>&gt; It means conscience, justice and love. </p> <p> </p> <p>What is the difference between someone who has good mind and does not? </p> <p>&gt; It is the result. </p> <p> </p> <p>What is the result of having a good mind? </p> <p>&gt; The result of having a good mind means that you can see the eternal life and heaven (the blessed land) due to enlightenment, wrong mind comes to have a grudge, the body of beasts and the hell due to it's darkness. </p> <p> </p> <p>Do you believe that people's mind can change the things of the world and the things of the world can change people's mind? </p> <p>&gt; Yes. </p> <p> </p> <p>If so why do not people try to enlighten themselves along with you who are aware of such things? </p> <p>&gt; That is because they still don't know the thingsof the world </p> <p> </p> <p>You conclude that people don't see their mind , how can we believe it? </p> <p>&gt; I know that by seeing them . </p> <p> </p> <p>What is the proof that you see them and know it? </p> <p>&gt; It is their view seeing the fact. People who have dark minds can not see the things just in front of themselves, people who have bright mind can see the things from a distance. </p> <p> </p> <p>Then what makes it possible to determine whether a mind is a dark or bright one? </p> <p>&gt; It is personality. </p> <p> </p> <p>In reality,what does a personality look like and what makes you say that you know their mind? </p> <p>&gt; When good mind hears facts, it tends to recognize truth as much as the brightness and when bad mind hears facts, it does not tend to recognize as much as the darkness. </p> <p> </p> <p>Do you believe you can prove all the things about the world and people? </p> <p>&gt; Yes. </p> <p> </p> <p>If so can you prove the things which happened in the past? </p> <p>&gt; Somethings are possible, others are not possible </p> <p> </p> <p>What is possible, and what is impossible? </p> <p>&gt; If the handed down record is about the world, even now we can prove something of; If the record is not based on the truth, we can not. </p> <p> </p> <p>Then what was Buddha like in the past? </p> <p>&gt; He was an enlightened man.</p> <p> </p> <p>Did he call himself a tathagata? </p> <p>&gt; Yes. </p> <p> </p> <p>What is the proof about the a tathagata? </p> <p>&gt; The proof is in the Buddist scripture. </p> <p> </p> <p>What is written in it? </p> <p>&gt; It is about the world. </p> <p> </p> <p>How can we recognize the world? </p> <p>&gt; You can understand it by the law of cause and effect. </p> <p> </p> <p>Then what was Jesus like when we see by way of the law of cause and effect? </p> <p>&gt; He was a true man. </p> <p> </p> <p>What was the proof that he was the true man? </p> <p>&gt; His mind, words and behavior. </p> <p> </p> <p>Then what is the proof? </p> <p>&gt; It is the New Testament. </p> <p> </p> <p>Are your words truthworthy? </p> <p>&gt; Yes. </p> <p> </p> <p>Nowadays there are appearances of men who claim the name of Jesus. Who are they? </p> <p>&gt; I do not know. </p> <p> </p> <p>What is the proof that they are not Jesus? </p> <p>&gt; It is in their words and behaviors. </p> <p> </p> <p>Then does Jesus have proof? </p> <p>&gt; Yes. </p> <p> </p> <p>What is it? </p> <p>&gt; His words, his behavior and the physical characteristics that he has. </p> <p>The words expain the law of cause and effect, the behavior is avoiding five desires, they mean that he does not want alcohol, meat, sexual passion, wealth and fame. His physical characteristic is described as a splendid physique.

You have to see that matter when you serve the world. </p> <p style=line-height:5mm> </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>What result can the man who serves the world get? </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>&gt; He will get virtue. </p> <p style=line-height:5mm> </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>What is virtue? </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>&gt; It means that good mind is created. </p> <p style=line-height:5mm> </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>What is the difference between the man with virtue and without? </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>&gt; It is like the difference of eyesight when we see things. </p> <p style=line-height:5mm> </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>If a man accumulates virtue sincerely and wants to see the world, can anyone else see the world in that way? </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>&gt; Yes. </p> <p style=line-height:5mm> </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>What is the solid proof to support your saying so far? </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>&gt; You shall see the proof after you serve the world with your sincerity. </p> <p style=line-height:5mm> </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>Thank you. Now, I have learned many things from you. But I have not known your history. Could you tell me your background now? </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>&gt; Yes. </p> <p style=line-height:5mm> </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>Who taught you and what kind of ascetic practice did you do? </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>&gt; I taught myself. Even though I tell you the process of my ascetic practices, it is difficult for you to understand unless you experience it. But I can tell you this with not hiding at all. </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>It takes lots of time and needs a lot of effort for a man to get a good mind through the world and to become Buddha with that mind. </p> <p style=line-height:5mm> </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>Then Is this the story based on your experience? </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>&gt; Yes. Long long time ago, I was able to get a good mind through the world. </p> <p style=line-height:5mm> </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>What is a good mind that you said? </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>&gt; It is conscience and courage by way of current expression. </p> <p style=line-height:5mm> </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>Do you believe that Buddha's way started from conscience and courage? </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>&gt; Yes. </p> <p style=line-height:5mm> </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>What is this result of conscience and courage that you have spoken of? </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>&gt; After I saw conscience I could take care of myself; after I saw courage I could live right along with the things in the world. </p> <p style=line-height:5mm> </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>What is the result of your keeping yourself and taking care of the world? </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>&gt; I could be free from reincarnation by my virtue, owing to this I came to get eternal life. </p> <p style=line-height:5mm> </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>Does it mean your body never dies and exists forever? </p> <p style=line-height:5mm>&gt; No. My body has changed countlessly. However my soul has never been scattered and stayed without changing. Thus I could be born again and over again with the original mind. The reason why my mind could not be Buddhas's mind is my virtue colud not reach that of Buddha. When I tried to know Buddha's way, my body got so old that I died. When I was born again, I happened to meet another world. Finally as my virtue came to know Buddha's way, the world made me climb over the enormous suffering. One of the tests was to let me enjoy wealth and fame. The world made me be born surrounded by alcoholic drink, women and meat, and forget what had happened in my past with affection and music. However I was not able to be contented in such surroundings. Among people no one knew the questions accumulated in my mind. Oneday, I happened to see another world which was different from mine. There, some people came of low birth, some people got emaciated from hunger and others were dying of diseases. It was not until then that I had seen the questions in my mind. </p> <p style=line-height:5mm> That made me discard my small duty (affection) and hit the road to serve the world's duty (sincerity). However, there was no one who has known the right way in fornt of me, this frustrated mind had to wander around the world. The more I listened to the people, the less I could know truth and facts. Wherever I went, I could not meet any teachers. At last I got a fact. It was that I hear through myself. </p> <p style=line-height:5mm> Even then the only thing I knew was confidence. I had such a burning enthusiasm to seek after truth and to accumulate virtue in the world that I could fight against a coldness, hunger, loneliness and despair. However time resulted in nothing. At that time I saw myself having neither will nor expectation for the first time. My body began to be full of silence such as seeing the world of death. From then, the message from heaven was heard through my mind. After then, however I saw the world, agony did not gather. Even though time went by, fantasy did not arise. It was not unitl then that I realized that mind with nothing was Buddha's mind. People did not believe my word, besides, they did not want to follow me because they had never seen Buddha before. From that time, I began to see myself who was lonely and this kind of thing let me know what I should do in the world. Immediately, five desires in myself disappeared, my mind became as bright as clear sky, when my mind reached all the things in the world, I could see the meaning of them. From that time, I started to look for people and preach the law of cause and effect, I allowed people to call me a tathagata.</p> <p style=line-height:5mm>Now, whoever wants to be the same as I, they should not forget sincerely what happened to me, and they should know what is right or wrong in themselves. If they want to know the result of all the things in the world, first of all they should understand the law of cause and effect. Whoever wants to know this law, they should have the enlightened mind first and this will be possible after serving the world. I should say that good roots are the origin of Buddha. </p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<ul><li><a href=#appearance>The appearance of an Enlightened Being</a></li> <li><a href=#what>What is Enlightenment?</a></li> <li><a href=#requirements>Requirements for an Enlightened Being</a></li> <li><a href=#period>The period of the advent of an Enlightened Being</a></li> <li><a href=#phenomena>Phenomena after being Enlightened</a></li> <li><a href=#teaching>The teaching of an Enlightened Being</a></li> <li><a href=#ability>The ability of an Enlightened Being</a></li> <li><a href=#value>The value of Enlightenment</a></li> <li><a href=#people>Things which people who want to be Enlightened must be careful of</a></li> <li><a href=#life>The life of an Enlightened Being</a></li></ul> <br/> <p class=blue><a name=appearance></a>The appearance of an Enlightened Being</p> <p>An enlightened being appeared on island of Yeon-Hwa in the southern sea of Korea in November, 1984. Since then, he has been calling himself a Tathagata and explaining what the enlightened being could do and why this era needs the enlightened being. But nobody has thought highly of what he said. So he is traveling all around the world, trying to reveal the way of mankind in the world.</p> <p class=blue><a name=what></a>What is Enlightenment?</p> <p>Enlightenment is opening eyes to what exists. From the moment when you attain the supreme enlightenment, you will be able to see what exists inside the principle that makes the things of the world exist. You will also recognize through what matter what exists comes into being and say it.</p> <p class=blue><a name=requirements></a>Requirements for an Enlightened Being</p> <p>In order to attain enlightenment, the exact way to the enlightenment must be known. Firstly, the activities of the karma which try to conquer you must be stopped. Secondly, you must be able to see what exists. Thirdly, there must be conscience and courage. Fourthly, the karma in you must become extinct through endless love.</p> <p class=blue><a name=period></a>The period of the advent of an Enlightened Being</p> <p>As mentioned above, the one who has attained the supreme enlightenment (the state of emancipation), calls himself a Tathagata. A Tathagata comes along only once with the period of about 3000 years. The aim of enlightened being's appearance is to reveal the way in the world for human beings.</p> <p class=blue><a name=phenomena></a>Phenomena after being Enlightened</p> <p>It is worthwhile to have interest in what phenomena happen to you if enlightenment is attained. This is because enlightenment can take the essence of consciousness to the greatest level. If enlightenment is attained, anguish and illusion will disappear, the five desires will become distant, and the matters which make things in the world exist will be perceived.</p> <p class=blue><a name=teaching></a>The teaching of an Enlightened Being</p> <p>An enlightened being says what exists. If you accept what he says as important, like when you learn mathematics, you will realize the fact that things in the world make their results through the single principle. Even if the teaching of the enlightened being is very easily explained, people who don't open their eyes to the truth of the world always have tremendous difficulties in accepting the teaching and practicing it.</p> <p class=blue><a name=ability></a>The ability of an Enlightened Being</p> <p>The ability of the perfectly enlightened being cannot be easily explained with any kinds of comparisons. This is because the range that the enlightened being can see cannot be defined with a certain limit. For example, the enlightened being sees much more things in a single principle than tens of millions of scientists who have appeared up until now, have found or revealed.</p> <p class=blue><a name=value></a>The value of Enlightenment</p> <p>The value of enlightenment cannot be compared with any other things. If enlightenment is attained, you will become the best existence in the world. If you are once enlightened, it makes you exist permanently and when you are born again in the future, your outstanding essence will make you a Tathagata or a Great King with great power.</p> <p class=blue><a name=people></a>Things which people who want to be Enlightened must be careful of</p> <p>Those who want enlightenment must first know how the one who has already been enlightened could attain the enlightenment. If you are fortunate enough to meet an enlightened being, it will make the best circumstances. But if not, you must not take any actions carelessly until you find the exact way to the enlightenment. If you meet those who aren't enlightened and follow their teaching, it may make yourself fall into serious dangers.</p> <p class=blue><a name=life></a>The life of an Enlightened Being</p> <p>If enlightenment is attained his life will become much harder. Firstly, he will become distant from people around him. Secondly, it will become difficult to reveal anywhere the things which he easily sees. It is because most people are being controlled by the karma inside themselves and so they are unwilling to stay near an enlightened being. Despite this reality, an enlightened being continues endlessly to do the work that he awakens the human world.</p>\";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<ul><li><a href=#you>Who are you?</a></li> <li><a href=#mission>What is your mission?</a></li> <li><a href=#message>What is your message?</a></li> <li><a href=#different>What makes you different from<br/>ordinary people?</a></li> <li><a href=#grow>How did you grow up?</a></li></ul> <br/> <p class=blue><a name=you></a>Who are you?</p> <p>In the world, the prophecy that a righteous person would appear in this era has come down from the past.

My family were slash-and-burn farmers. My father was ill, so mother had to take care of all the children by herself. We were so poor that I only managed to survive with the soup of the roots of plants and the barks of trees when I was born. One day, about a few days after I was born, I have been abandoned in the mountains for a while. About a year after I was born, my father passed away. My mother passed away as well when I was 9. From that time on, inevitably, I had to grow up in extreme difficulties where I had to take care of myself without any help from those in my surroundings. Despite this, I began to show outstanding leadership from the age of about 20. When I entered the political world at the age of 25, it caused a big sensation. I got married at the age of 33 and I now have a son and a daughter. I attained the supreme enlightenment at the age of 44 and now, I am here.</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<p>&brvbar; Pagoda Park.

What I found out was that Puna University was famous in philosophy.<br/>I visited Puna University and knocked on the door of the vice chancellor&rsquo;s.<br/>I found out later that the person, who I saw when the door was open, was the vice chancellor. But I didn&rsquo;t know him at that time so I asked him,<br/>&ldquo;Could you tell me where the chancellor is?&rdquo;<br/>The person in front of me said, &ldquo;What is the reason that you are looking for him?&rdquo;<br/>I said to him showing Teacher&rsquo;s message,<br/>&ldquo;This person came to Puna from Korea and he&rsquo;d like to meet intellectuals of India.&rdquo;<br/>The person read the teacher&rsquo;s message and without hesitation he fixed a time and said he would meet Teacher.<br/>I went to Puna University with Teacher the day of the appointment.<br/>When teacher and I arrived at the office of the vice chancellor, two people welcomed us. One was the person who I&rsquo;d met the last time, the other was I had not seen before.<br/>I asked the person I met last time, indicating the new person,<br/>&ldquo;Is he the chancellor?&rdquo;<br/>The person who I met last time said he wasn&rsquo;t.<br/>I only then knew the person who I met the last time was the vice chancellor, Doctor Gupta. The other person was a widely known professor in psychology.<br/>I, first, introduced to both people the teacher who came from Korea, and later introduced both people to Teacher, but the teacher introduced himself to them.<br/>&ldquo;I am the person who is the most truthful man in the world.&rdquo;<br/>I was worried if they were confused about the teacher&rsquo;s words. So I made an additional remark in a hurry.<br/>&ldquo;He is saying about the visual angle that he has.&rdquo;<br/>It seemed that they were accepting teacher&rsquo;s words without rejection. Teacher asked a few questions to the chancellor and the professor. And the teacher said that if there were things they wanted to know, to ask him.<br/>At that time, Doctor Gupta, the chancellor of Puna University, said.<br/>&ldquo;Could you tell me where my soul exists?&rdquo;<br/>Teacher answered like this.<br/>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. But before I tell it, I&rsquo;ll give you a question first. After listening to your answer, I&rsquo;ll tell you to understand easily about it.&rdquo;<br/>The chancellor asked again.<br/>&ldquo;What are you going to question?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Where are beans from?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t a bean come from a bean?&rdquo;<br/>Teacher said with a delighted smile.<br/>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct. A bean comes from a bean. However, from a bean&rsquo;s point of view, because it is rooted to the ground it could see differently. As a bean comes from a bean, so your soul is in you. Your soul is made through your activity. And you will be born again due to things that were in your soul.&rdquo;<br/>Doctor Gupta was very sufficient and said,<br/>&ldquo;Many people around us tried to know about such a thing but were not able to know.&rdquo;<br/>Doctor Gupta and the professor had many conversations with Teacher since then. When the appointment time was over, it was time to separate. Doctor Gupta said to Teacher,<br/>&ldquo;The words that you told us today were very beneficial. When you come to Puna next time, could you visit us without fail, please.&rdquo;<br/>Teacher delightedly consented and the chancellor and the professor respectfully sent off us.</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Imports\nvar ___HTML_LOADER_GET_SOURCE_FROM_IMPORT___ = require(\"../../../node_modules/html-loader/dist/runtime/getUrl.js\");\nvar ___HTML_LOADER_IMPORT_0___ = require(\"./bodygaya_under_bodh_tree_with_monks.jpg\");\n// Module\nvar ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_0___ = ___HTML_LOADER_GET_SOURCE_FROM_IMPORT___(___HTML_LOADER_IMPORT_0___);\nvar code = \"<h3 align=center>TRAVEL TO BODH GAYA<br/>by meok kim</h3> <p>10th October in 1994, 3 of our party went to Calcutta station in order to go to Bodh Gaya. We were unable to get tickets to our next destination easily. The station was crowded, with long queues of people lined up at each ticket window.</p> <p>Because we were imminent, we asked whomever where train tickets to Bodh Gaya were sold. We were told to go anther part of the station, but once we got there we were told to go to another location. Once there, a person who listened to us indicated somewhere else. Within the station, we spent over thirty minutes just to find a ticket window that sold tickets to Budh Gaya.<br/>Another thing that caused difficulties was that there was a longer queue in front of this ticket window than any other ticket windows.</p> <p>We were anxious to see if we could purchase train tickets to depart that day. The delay was due to slow action by the cashier, who was selling tickets with an old model computer. We, who were standing in a long queue that didn&rsquo;t easily shrink, were gloomy.</p> <p>Some tough men came near to us and said they would get train tickets for us, so we exited the queue. We asked these people how much a train ticket to depart that day would cost but they made us wait, came back after a time, and said it was impossible to get train tickets to depart that day. In addition, the purchase price quoted was several times greater than the ticket price in the station.</p> <p>We gave up dealing with these people and decided to go to the stationmaster&rsquo;s office in person. We met the stationmaster and explained the purpose of our travel to India, and that we had to go to Bodh Gaya and requested his help. However, we were refused flatly. It was difficult for us to get tickets urgently. So, finally, we gave up on buying tickets and went back to our hotel.</p> <p>Upon our arrival back at the hotel, our leader went out alone. He soon returned saying that he needed an interpreter and took me out. Cheap accommodation around the hotel was plentiful, of the sort that rucksack travellers utilised. businesses focused on travellers, and small travel agencies that sold cheap air plane tickets.</p> <p>Leader took me to a travel agency and told me to translate his words.</p> <p>&lsquo;Is it possible to buy such and such a train ticket?&rsquo;</p> <p>After the owner of the agency listened to our words for a while, he introduced us to another house.</p> <p>This house was located on the road, and doing business with a telephone and two chairs. Leader asked the owner of the small shop.</p> <p>&ldquo;Can I get train tickets to depart this evening?&rdquo;</p> <p>The owner of the shop handed over a piece of paper and asked to write down in detail the destination and class of train that we wanted. As we passed over the paper, the shop owner made a phone call. Afterward, he said that day was impossible and asked about tickets for the day after. At that time, leader bargained with the owner of the shop.</p> <p>&ldquo;I will put a premium on.&rdquo;</p> <p>The owner asked us how much we would put on.<br/>Leader said if the price was 1000 rupee per person, he would purchase tickets. The owner requested payment of 1,500 rupee, so leader said he would pay the middle.</p> <p>The owner made phone calls again here and there with enthusiasm. After a while, he said it was possible to get the tickets that we wanted so we paid the agreed upon sum. After receiving the payment receipt, we received a paper on which the train&rsquo;s name, number, and seat number were written by the shop owner. The shop owner said that when we caught the train, the person in charge of the compartment would come and give us tickets.</p> <p>Therefore, we could take the train that departed at 8 O&rsquo;clock that evening from Calcutta station.</p> <p>The compartment of the train we took was being utilised by upper middle class Indian people. What we originally ordered and paid for was four people in a four sleeping berth, but what we actually got was six people in a 2nd class compartment.</p> <p>We had to inevitably share the compartment with other Indians besides our party. On top of this, we had to share with other Indians who couldn&rsquo;t get tickets besides Indians who had purchased tickets.</p> <p>The train conductor told us the train would arrive in Gaya station around half past 2 at the middle of the night. We had to pay attention to our belongings at all times if we weren&rsquo;t to lose them. Indians in our compartment were continuously having conversations mixing English and Indian, whilst Indians who took the train without a ticket, asked the train conductor to find them 2nd class sleeping berths whenever he passed.</p> <p>We were anxious not to pass Gaya station, so we checked every station the train stopped at. At dawn the next day the train conductor came to us and told us that the next station was Gaya station, and to get off with our luggage. Exhausted our party collected each others belongings and got off the train.</p> <p>The reason we had to get off at Gaya station was because there wasn&rsquo;t a train station in Budh Gaya. In order to go to Budh Gaya we had to get off at Gaya station and take another form of transportation.</p> <p>Despite it being daybreak, Gaya station was in confusion. People were lying on the floor, trying to sleep in every corner of the station, swarms of flies gathered where ever lights were.</p> <p>We went to a restroom that only 1st and 2nd class customers could use. A woman was checking tickets at the 2nd floor entrance in order to regulate general passengers. The restroom was divided into women&rsquo;s and men&rsquo;s use, and there was a toilet and washroom on one side. However, the facilities were far from our expectations. People were laying cloth on the floor and lying here and there. A few chairs were there, so our party could rest for a while.</p> <p>Because we were worried about losing our belongings, we gathered our luggage and passed a sleepless night watching over it.</p> <p>Leader went down station square pushing passed people. After a while leader came back. The vehicle that leader bargained for and reserved was called a rickshaw. It was made by reconstructing a motor cycle to seat a few people, a little vehicle that Indians utilise a lot. This rickshaw had 3 wheels, and a seat for two or three people seated closely. Three of our party rode on the rickshaw with three big pieces of luggage. Besides our party the driver took on one of his friends. Then the rickshaw set off.</p> <p>As it was our first trip, the roads were new to us, and as it was dark we couldn&rsquo;t neglect to be on the alert. The rickshaw that was carrying us stopped after a half hour drive. We were completely tensed, and asked what the reason was. The driver remained cool and said the fuel had run out.<br/>Leader called attention to us.</p> <p>&ldquo;If an unpleasant thing happens, each of you just run in different directions.&rdquo;</p> <p>Prepared for an extreme situation, we waited for the driver to return with fuel. The driver came back about an hour later with fuel, the rickshaw started to move again.</p> <p>Because we got some general knowledge about Buda Gaya and possible accommodation, before leaving Calcutta, when we arrived in Buda Gaya we stopped the car in front of Butane temple. We went into the temple, and asked if we could get rooms in their guesthouse.</p> <p>A monk, who was bargaining the price of the room with us, said it was 80 rupee a room on the ground floor, and 400 rupee a room on the first floor. Therefore, we decided to take rooms on the ground floor. At that time 80 rupee was about 3 dollars.</p> <p>Leader put his belongings in his room, changed his clothes and told us to go to have breakfast. However, we couldn&rsquo;t find a restaurant in Budh Gaya that we thought would exist.</p> <p>It wasn&rsquo;t long after we left the guest house and were walking when a boy around 14 years old came over to us and, in fluent Japanese, asked where we were going. Because I luckily could speak Japanese, I asked the boy where we could have a meal. The boy took us to an isolated place on a street.</p> <p>Putting up a tent and laying a board on one side, someone was making food on the roadside.</p> <p>We forced ourselves to eat this food, which wasn&rsquo;t our taste. We asked for rice, but they made traditional Indian spicy side dishes. We cut seaweed that we had brought, and mixed rice with a little bit of a side dish, and wrapped in seaweed then ate, barely.</p> <p>When we finished breakfast, the boy who showed us the restaurant caught up with us again, with some other boys also following after. We refuse them if they would bother us, but they said to feel easy as they don&rsquo;t ask for anything. Therefore, we went to &ldquo;Main Temple&rdquo; direct with them, to the place where Shakyamuni Buddha obtained the enlightenment, and we were introduced to the owner of a shop near the main temple.</p> <p>The owner of the shop was very interested in, and cooperative, after listening to the purpose of our visit, and what leader does. The rumour that our party came soon spread within the small Budh Gaya village. Therefore, we were able to meet many other people with ease, and so found a way to do that we were trying to do.</p> <p>We showed a message manuscript that we had written to local man called Tipanka, who could speak English. He translated the manuscript to English and Hindu for us. We also went to Gaya with his aid where we had a hanging banner made in a print shop with writing containing the content of the message. This was done on a big cloth painted in a signboard shop. Hereby we were ready for our work.</p> <p>When it became 10 O&rsquo;clock in the morning, we went to a down town square next to the main temple where shops were lined. Hanging the message written on a cloth on a big bodhitree in the square, we started to have meetings with people under the tree.</p> <img align=center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_0___ + \" /><br/> <p>People, at first, didn&rsquo;t come near us as though they were on guard against us. Most of the people were only watching our party from a distance. When time passed people began to come near to us and asked questions. Their questions were very simple things.</p> <p>Time passed. Buddhist priests of the main temple passed in front of us. Some young men in Budh Gaya blocked their way and told them to go to leader and ask questions. Priests, who were caught by these young men, unavoidably had to come in front of our party and leader gave them simple teachings.</p> <p>One of them said.</p> <p>&ldquo;Buddha already told us every word that you have said.&rdquo;</p> <p>Leader answered.</p> <p>&ldquo;You are the people who know one, but don&rsquo;t know another one. However much good food, when it gets changed in quality and goes bad, it become the same as poison. Good teaching is also the same as this. Truth that is changed in quality is as same as poison. If you don&rsquo;t realise it, however much Buddha&rsquo;s teaching is good, you won&rsquo;t get anything which is helpful for yourself.&rdquo;</p> <p>The priests could say no more.</p> <p>Young men around us held up people passing through, indicating leader and saying to them that if they had anything they wanted to know to go to leader and ask.</p> <p>Coaches carrying tourists were arriving continuously by the bodhitree, under which we were sitting. A party got off a coach, and a woman among them came over to our party. She was very interested in her future. She asked if she would be successful or not in her future.</p> <p>Leader answered like this.</p> <p>&ldquo;I would be able to answer the question as to whether you would be successful or not after seeing what you are doing.&rdquo;</p> <p>However, the woman didn&rsquo;t understand leader&rsquo;s words easily. Leader said her again.</p> <p>&ldquo;Things of the world appear by a formula. Because decision is deffered according to where and what things are.&rdquo;</p> <p>And yet, she didn&rsquo;t understand these words easily. Leader shouted toward her party.</p> <p>&ldquo;Someone came to me this morning and said life is suffering.&rdquo; So I said this,<br/>&ldquo;If you live without knowing existent things, things in life will exhaust life. If you live knowing existent things, then things in life will cause life to be pleasant.&rdquo;</p> <p>After listening to leader&rsquo;s words, the woman said,<br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to stand for parliament election.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;What is the reason you cannot stand for election?&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;In order to stand for election I have to be named by a political party, but it is difficult.&rdquo;</p> <p>Leader replied, &ldquo;Hitler didn&rsquo;t have any supporters at first, but by building support by himself he stood for parliament and won. Do you really want to be a member of parliament?&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;Yes, I do&rdquo;, she replied.</p> <p>&ldquo;If you tell me the reason clearly why you want to be a member of parliament, I will tell you the way to be a member of parliament.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;If I become an MP, I can do things that will be helpful to people in this area.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;People, whoever say the same as you. But when they become an MP, they are different. So, if you tell me what you will try to do, and your plans in detail, I will tell you in detail how you can get support. What I see while I am having this conversation with you, it isn&rsquo;t easy for you to be elected as an MP, with your wisdom and judgement. However, If I give you things that I have, it won&rsquo;t be difficult for you to be elected as an MP in this area.&rdquo;</p> <p>She replied, &ldquo;Thank you very much. But I&rsquo;d like to know if my life would be successful or not.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;Do you mind if my answer doesn&rsquo;t suit your taste?&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;Destiny is neither fixed nor fluid. If you don&rsquo;t try to better yourself, you will live in the fixed destiny and die, and if you make better destiny, your destiny will be fluid. Even if I say certain words, whether those words are correct or incorrect depend on your behaviour. Because of that, I won&rsquo;t say about individual destiny. However, if you want to have a good destiny, I will tell you the way to make good destiny by yourself. If you want to be rich, I will tell you the way to be rich. If you want to be a politician, I will tell you the way to be a politician.&rdquo;</p> <p>The woman and her party listened intently to leader&rsquo;s words, and when his words finished, they said thank you and left.</p> <p>One man, who was standing in the circle, asked if he could ask a question.</p> <p>And leader said to him. &ldquo;What question are you going to ask me?&rdquo;</p> <p>The man asked, &ldquo;Could you tell me what clothes my wife is wearing now?&rdquo;</p> <p>Leader answered.&ldquo;If you take me in front of your wife, I will see your wife and then I will immediately tell you what clothes your wife is wearing.&rdquo;</p> <p>The man, who questioned, said sneering. &ldquo;Everybody can do such a thing, can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p> <p>Leader asked him again. &ldquo;Then why did you ask it of me?&rdquo;</p> <p>Other men, who were standing near to him, said, &ldquo;Otosang (father in Japanese) in Budh Gaya knows everything. Sitting near the river, he knows what is happening in another&rsquo;s house. And if we ask what clothes our family is wearing, he knows it and tells us.&rdquo;</p> <p>After listening to these words, leader said to these people, &ldquo;If so, can you take me in front of him? If he can answer my questions I will give you a chance to earn a lot of money.&rdquo;</p> <p>Young men about the place showed interest in leader&rsquo;s words, so our party and these people went to visit a man who lived near the Budh Gaya river.<br/>When our party arrived riverside, the young men who brought us there went before us to the eccentric person who lived on the riverside, and spoke to him about our party. A lot of people, who had heard our story, were following behind us in order to watch. The man, who the people of Budh Gaya called &lsquo;Otosang&rsquo;, listened to the story of these young men, made our party wait for a while by the riverside. After a while, the young men took our party in front of the eccentric man.</p> <p>When leader met the man, who called &lsquo;Otosang&rsquo;, he said like this.<br/>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come here with intent to give you a trouble. These people, who don&rsquo;t know anything, took me to you. Are you able to recognise me?&rdquo;</p> <p>This man, who told others fortunes, and answered peoples questions mysteriously, dropped his head and said, &ldquo;You are the one who has a very strong power. I&rsquo;d like to work like you.&rdquo;</p> <p>Leader laughed loudly and said.</p> <p>&ldquo;It is difficult for everybody to work like me. But if you obtain enlightenment, you will be able to work like me.&rdquo;</p> <p>As the conversation finished so flat the young men who took our party there wore a disappointed look.</p> <p>Leader stood up without further questioning the eccentric man who couldn&rsquo;t even raise his head.</p> <p>The achievements of our party during the day spread out among the people in a city as little as Budh Gaya in the twinkling of an eye.</p> <p>That night, after dinner, we were having a rest on the grass in our accommodation building. Boys who followed us that day came to us and said a woman wanted to see leader.</p> <p>Leader told them to bring her.</p> <p>The woman, who called at our accommodation said this.<br/>&ldquo;My husband died 2 years ago. My husband had no illness before he died, nor on the day he died either. He worked well, as usual, then returned home and died without any reason. Are you able to know the reason why my husband died?&rdquo;</p> <p>Leader answered.<br/>&ldquo;There is dead man in your house. The dead man pressed your husband below the shoulder. When the place was pressed, the blood vessel that linked to his head was pressed. Because blood couldn&rsquo;t go through to his head normally, his brain came to stop its activity. When this phenomenon occurred your husband couldn&rsquo;t express any consciousness, like a vegetable, and only felt oppressed in one of his breast. When your husband died, the hospital would have diagnosed a heart attack. Is this correct or incorrect?&rdquo;</p> <p>The woman answered it was correct, and asked again.<br/>&ldquo;Could you tell me what&rsquo;s the reason our business doesn&rsquo;t pay?&rdquo;</p> <p>Leader answered.<br/>&ldquo;It is because there is a dead man in your house. The dead man makes people not come.&rdquo;</p> <p>As though the woman solved her doubt, she said thank you and returned.</p> <p>And a few day passed. A young man called on us and requested we give a talk for beggars in his village.</p> <p>Leader gave a willing consent, and our party went to the village.</p> <p>Most of the people there were people who were begging from tourists, and even though I translated leader&rsquo;s words in English, only a few people understood English. However, leader explained for them about things that make things of the world exist. But it looked like no one among them understood leader&rsquo;s words correctly.</p> <p>In front of leader who had been explaining the things of the world enthusiastically for more than half an hour, a young beggar suddenly produced a notebook. It was a notebook that recorded contributions of visitors who called at the village. Leader looked at the notebook for a short while and said to them.</p> <p>&ldquo;You have to finish the life as a beggar in your life. If you continue such a thing, your children will do so, and your children&rsquo;s children will be beggars. You have to learn the way to live by yourself. Thus, you have to learn to work, and even if it is hard now, you have to teach your children letters and work. That is the only way you can fill up your wants.&rdquo;</p> <p>Speaking the words, leaders face was unusually flushed, and the boys, who took our party there, listened to leader&rsquo;s words and agreed.</p> <p>It had been about a week since we arrived in Budh Gaya. That day we were in Butane temple. Several boys in the village called there and wanted to see leader.</p> <p>I asked them what was the matter they wanted to see leader about. The boys said a person from Gaya visited them who said that he was enlightened. He was a Nepalese man, an expert in cancer, and taught many followers in Gaya. The boys said that the man had heard the rumour that a guru (great teacher) had come to Budh Gaya and so he had come to Budh Gaya and was staying at a house in the village in order to confirm the fact. The boys asked if leader would like to see him.</p> <p>I reported their story to leader, leader laughed and went with us to the boy&rsquo;s house where the person from Gaya was staying.</p> <p>When leader met the Nepalese man he asked like this.<br/>&ldquo;Do you see the third eye on my forehead?&rdquo; Leader let the man from Nepal see leader&rsquo;s face closely.</p> <p>The Nepal man said.<br/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the third eye.&rdquo;</p> <p>After listening to the words, leader said again like this.<br/>&ldquo;Then I will ask you 10 questions, if you answer two of my questions correctly, I&rsquo;ll recommend the words that you said just before.&rdquo;</p> <p>The Nepal man said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand English very well.&rdquo;</p> <p>Leader said, &ldquo;we shall do it in Hindu, shan&rsquo;t we? I know someone who can speak Hindu and English in this village, letting him translate for us, we will be able to transfer each others opinion?&rdquo;</p> <p>People who had come from Gaya with the Nepal man agreed with leader&rsquo;s words, and boys in Budh Gaya village said it was a good idea. Because people favoured that opinion, if the Nepal man couldn&rsquo;t help, with his party came to go Tipanka&rsquo;s house who can speak Hindu and English.</p> <p>Leader asked Tipanka to translate for us, Tipanka willingly consented.</p> <p>Leader first asked the Nepalese man a question in regards to his intent.<br/>&ldquo;Would you like me to ask you a question first or would you like to ask me a question?&rdquo;</p> <p>The Nepal man said, &ldquo;You ask me a question, first.&rdquo;<br/>He also said he would answer leader&rsquo;s question.</p> <p>Leader asked, &ldquo;What is Truth?&rdquo;</p> <p>The Nepal man seemed to be confused when leader asked him this question. And he started to answer tediously. Leader clapped his two hands strongly in front of the many people watching. A &lsquo;Clap!&rsquo; sound came out from between his hands. Leader asked the man from Nepal.<br/>&ldquo;From where did the sound come?&rdquo;</p> <p>The Nepal man answered, &ldquo;The sound came from the universe.&rdquo;</p> <p>Leader laughed at the answer and said, &ldquo;I made the sound bumping my hands. You are explaining what it is too leaping.&rdquo;</p> <p>The Nepalese man was upset and said in an excited tone.<br/>&ldquo;Then I will ask you a question.&rdquo;</p> <p>Leader said with composure.<br/>&ldquo;Then you ask me a question.&rdquo;</p> <p>The Nepal man asked.<br/>&ldquo;What is it which is faster than light and faster than sound?&rdquo;</p> <p>Leader answered immediately like this.<br/>&ldquo;It is consciousness. The light takes a few minutes to come to earth. But consciousness can see the sun at once.&rdquo;</p> <p>Tipanka queried the Nepal man while he was translating, &ldquo;Is it correct or incorrect?&rdquo;</p> <p>The other party said it was correct. And he said to leader, &ldquo;I gave you too easy a question.&rdquo;</p> <p>Leader replied, &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a thing which is particularly easy and difficult in the world. Things of the world, every question and answer, exist in what it is. I see what it is and only answered what it is to you.&rdquo;</p> <p>People who listened to leader could say no more. When leader saw that the atmosphere had become heavy, he said to the Nepalese man in gentle manner.<br/>&ldquo;You will be able to be my good friend. Let&rsquo;s make good friends.&rdquo;<br/>Saying so, leader stretched out his hand.</p> <p>And the man from Nepal agreed to these words and shaking leader&rsquo;s hand smiled.</p> <p>The people gathered there clapped.<br/>Our party come out of that place soon. We were going to leave Buda Gaya the next day. Our next destination was a city called Saranadh.</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/bodygaya_under_bodh_tree_with_monks.6753bf38.jpg\";","// Module\nvar code = \"<h3 align=center>AT INDIAN INSTITUTE<br/>OF TECHNOLOGY<br/>by meok kim</h3> <p>I was in India November in 1996. IIT University is one of the most prestigious universities in India with excellent students and faculty. We met and spoke with some of them for 2 hours, from 7pm to 9pm on 19th November. Approximately 400 people, ranging from students to professors, gathered in the student&rsquo;s hall. What I would like to introduce here is the record of the lecture with questions and answers that I heard.</p> <p class=blue align=center>-Introduction Speech-</p> <p>I am Enlightened</p> <p>I say that I am the man who attained the Supreme Enlightenment and I believe that my Enlightenment can be helpful for your life and for the future of mankind.</p> <p>I am a truly Enlightened being.</p> <p>I can give you some examples which can prove my claims. I had to undergo through many big trials before I became Enlightened. Nobody amongst you will undergo such trials.</p> <p>In fact, I had never imagined that I would attain Enlightenment until I obtained it and I was not aware that I would do any special work for this world. I had some period when I was very anxious about my situation in life that I could not do anything for others in spite of my abilities and I questioned myself about what had happened in my own life.</p> <p>I suffered extraordinary trials from my birth. I was not given any affection during my growing up. I was despised by my parents. I was looked down upon by neighbours. I faced cruelty even from my brother. Later, I was oppressed by people in power. I didn't have any school education nor any help from others. There were lots of difficulties which I had to solve by myself from my childhood. Whenever I came across the problems something mysterious happened and I was protected. I could solve all problems when I wanted.</p> <p>In the same way my Enlightenment happened. I had no problems for myself or my family at that time. However, the social circumstances prevented me from doing my daily work. Then, I was guided by my consciousness to go to a calm place. I went to a small island, named Yonwhado. I retreated to myself. I was forty-four and it was November 1984. I lived alone in a remote house. One day I had some questions - about what happened in my life. At that moment one question occurred in my consciousness, \\\"Go back to the past\\\".</p> <p>I had a next question and a new answer appeared from myself, which indicated me to go back to the world where I came from before my birth in this world. And I found myself at the entrance of the world of Enlightenment. I started to count backwards the years of my life, closing my eyes, lying down, 44, 43, 42, 41 ........ When I counted the last one, an absolutely calm world appeared in my consciousness. There was an object emitting light in the empty space. It was the only thing that I saw. Then five desires disappeared from the body, worries and illusions stopped, sadness and hate disappeared from the consciousness. After this I passed into Enlightenment.</p> <p>After some time I knew what I had to do. So I met and searched for people and I had to tell what is in truth. I looked strange in people's eyes. However, I had to inform the reality of the fact to them. Because of my pursuit my neighbours, relatives and my friends all left me. When people listened to me, most of them did not want to see me again. In spite of all this, I am still trying to tell you the things in Truth. I wonder if you will also distance yourself from me after reading this. In spite of my understanding of people's attitude, I want to reveal the reality in truth because there are some problems in the world that you have to realize and there are some answers that you don't know. It is not easy for you and anybody else to see them with human faculties. If somebody claims that he is Enlightened or that he can tell the truth, you do need to try testing and confirming such claims. He will have to show me the proof for his claims. I do not believe that there is another Enlightened Being in this age except me, that is why my mind is so anxious.</p> <p>I can't give up my work in despair and discouragement. So I have been explaining repeatedly about my Enlightenment because I wanted to help you and the things about to happen in this world. There is too big a gap between your viewpoint and mine. Thought exists in your words but truth exists in my words. That's why I look a total stranger to human eyes. Truth exists everywhere and it exists in what you are doing.</p> <p>Knowing truth is to bless oneself.<br/>Revealing truth is to bless this world.</p> <p>When people understand truth they don't deceive others and don't do anything harmful to others.<br/>When people know truth they can be free from poverty and ignorance.<br/>When people know truth they can find the way to eternal life and the cycle of rebirth. When people know truth they can see how the world works.</p> <p>However, If they don't have an opportunity to meet the Enlightened Being then they don't find where the truth that they are looking for is. Therefore, to gain truth from meeting the Enlightened Being is like gaining the most valuable and rare treasure in this world because it is very seldom that the Enlightened Being appears into this world. Furthermore, it is impossible for most ordinary people to meet the Enlightened Being in human society.</p> <p>I had to come into this world as there is a particular reason, because something big is to happen in this world in this age. The world has kept existing until now by Appointment. This world has been existing by the process of things dying and being reborn. We observed many a phenomenon in the matter and the creatures. All these happen by Appointment which makes this world exist. The world and all that is in this world has been existing by Appointment. The present mankind also cannot escape this Appointment. You don't have any solution about this phenomenon. That's why the human world needed an Enlightened Being. Is that why I had to endure such terrible trials after my coming into this world? The reason is that there is an extremely urgent problem in our age. There are some who will die forever ; there are some who will live forever. This will depend upon what is within you and what shall be in you. Your destiny is created by what is within you. Nobody can live or survive beyond and without Appointment. My coming into this world and revealing truth is to fulfill your demands and needs.</p> <p>I have not demanded anything from the people. The only thing I ask of you is your interest and assistance in my work to reveal the truth. Most people whom I have met have easily denied my Enlightenment and even ridiculed me. I know the Appointment that creates and keeps the world going. I can solve the problem that you must become aware of in your life.</p> <p>I am Tathagata.</p> <p>I am the man who came to the world to reveal things in Truth.</p> <p>To give up yourself or to save yourself ; that is your own decision and you have to make that decision in this age. My message to you is that you yourself are your own Messiah who will be able to save your own life. The Messiah who some people are waiting for will never come to this world, I truly promise it. If there are some who deny my view, please show me the proof. I have never deceived others and have never done anything harmful to others in the past and will not do so in the future.</p> <p>I am sure that my Enlightenment could be beneficial for the world. If you need more explanation about my message please let me have any questions.</p> <p>I emphasize again this point - Try to see what it is, confirm what it is and judge what it is.<br/>This manner will be helpful for your life.<br/>I am in agony as to how I can inform you of such things. I have travelled endlessly these past 12 years. This is already the 8th visit to India. However, there are few who asked questions after listening to my words. As if Indian people also became taciturn as people in other countries did, there were a few people who asked questions of me, and no one answered my questions.</p> <p>There are so many things that are different between the knowledge that you have, and things that are in Truth that I saw. If you don&rsquo;t confirm such things you cannot get anything from me and I cannot give you anything either.</p> <p>Therefore, I would like to ask you questions about 3 terminologies and then I would like to have your questions about the doubt that you have, and answer to the questions. First of all, I believe that you have learned the word of &lsquo;conscience&rsquo; since you were young in school and society. Then what does the conscience do to yourself. I would like to hear your opinions first. If there is one who can answer, please do so.</p> <p class=blue>Questions and Answers</p> <p>Question : When I listened to you, you seemed very strong. Then, why can you not speak English?</p> <p>Answer : I have never had specific English education. Enlightenment is opening eyes to things of the world, but it is not becoming a master in every functional thing. If you are concerned about a matter of language, I want you to confirm through people in the past. Gautama could not speak English and Jesus Christ could not, either. I would like you to understand I am the same as them.</p> <p>Question : Jesus and Buddha did not say that they were enlightened.</p> <p>Answer : Jesus is not the one who accomplished perfect enlightenment. However, Gautama made clear that he was one who was enlightened.</p> <p>Question : Could you show us the evidence of your claim?</p> <p>Answer : Which evidence do you mean?</p> <p>Question : I mean the evidence that you are enlightened.</p> <p>Answer : I have the evidence of the supreme enlightenment among the people who came to the world for 6000 years. Look at my face. I have a bulge in the middle of my forehead. This is the third eye about which you could hear only from a legend. No body has this kind of evidence up to now.</p> <p>Question : xx of India also has the same bulge.</p> <p>Answer : Then you should confirm it with me. If he can say what is as it is and explain what is as I do he must be an enlightened being, too. But it is absolutely impossible for such thing to happen in this era.</p> <p>Question : What made you have such confidence in the fact that you were enlightened. How can you say that you are helpful to the world? Why should I believe your claim?</p> <p>Answer : I say that I was enlightened because I was enlightened. I also say to you that I do something useful, because what I do can result in useful things. I say that you should believe because my words are in Truth.</p> <p>Question : Can people get enlightenment just by counting age backwards? What is the way to Buddha or enlightenment?</p> <p>Answer : Gautama Buddha did not explain in detail how he could reach enlightenment. However, I know the question how I, myself, could be enlightened. Actually it is almost impossible for ordinary people to get enlightenment in a lifetime. As the evidence, there were only two people for 6000 years who claimed they were enlightened. One was Gautama who was born in India. And I came to this world. Only counting age backwards cannot make you enlightened. In order to be enlightened I had to go back to the world of origin, which is the world before birth. To go back to the world of origin at that time I enlightened, I made such a thing happen in me. I was already an enlightened being in the past world and when I came to the present world, due to things at that time, I could be born as an enlightened being.</p> <p>Question : How can you know all the people in the world? And how can you say that nobody has experienced and will experience the ordeals that you have undergone?</p> <p>Answer : It is because there is no one who is burdened with the burden of the world like me and is able to be burdened.</p> <p>Question : what is Truth?</p> <p>Answer : Truth refers to things that makes what is exist.</p> <p>Question : What is the way to make Truth come true?</p> <p>Answer : It is to confirm existent things and to know correctly existent things.</p> <p>Question : Could you tell who raises the money for the travel?</p> <p>Answer : I do not have any sponsors. So it is very hard while travelling and also hard to manage to raise money.</p> <p>Question : Do you get angry?</p> <p>Answer : When I see wrong things or my hope goes wrong, I sometimes get angry. However, I do not have such feelings as anger or sorrow.</p> <p>Question : Why are you so anxious for the fact that you can not give the resolution of problems in the world if you are an enlightened being?</p> <p>Answer : That is because the future of mankind and you depend on my effort.</p> <p>Question : What can you see through things of the world?</p> <p>Answer : It is Truth.</p> <p>Question : If you can not see everything through your physical eyes, how can you prove the fact that you can see everything with the third eye?</p> <p>Answer : The assertion of my enlightenment is my words and action. Checking my words out will confirm your doubt.</p> <p>Question : If you are enlightened why can not you solve problems in Korea?</p> <p>Answer : Everyone has its own destiny. And that destiny has effects on the society. The people who have the destiny to perish, do not welcome people who do not ruin them. I tried to solve the problems around me, but nobody accepted such as me. Gautama was the one who also experienced the same thing as I experience.</p> <p>Question : Could you tell us how to see life. You said that it was very difficult for ordinary people to be enlightened. If so, isn&rsquo;t it a waste of time that we listen to your teaching?</p> <p>Answer : No, it is not. It is very important to get the way to enlightenment from an enlightened being. The reason why I said that most people cannot attain enlightenment is that it is rare that an enlightened being appears in the world.</p> <p>Question : If the way to enlightenment is so hard, what should people do?</p> <p>Answer : People should learn from an enlightened being how he could attain enlightenment.</p> <p>Question : Could you explain about death?</p> <p>Answer : The question about death is the same as the question about the world after death. In the posthumous world there exist a few different dimensions. The dimension which you come to reach is determined by what was in your life. Most of the people who I know went to the most miserable world after they died. If you want to know this kind of thing in more detail, visit the place where I stay, ask questions in that area and listen to my explanation for a couple of hours. Then you will understand a little.</p> <p>Question : Are you born again after this life?</p> <p>Answer : I cannot promise when I should come back to the world again. I did not have to be born in this era, but it was because there wasn&rsquo;t any alternative plan in order to reveal things that are in the world.</p> <p>Question : You do not have any logical evidence which can back up your assertion. Can you demonstrate your enlightenment logically?</p> <p>Answer : What do you mean by &lsquo;logical&rsquo;? My words are not incorrect at any parts.</p> <p>Question : What is the truth of this world?</p> <p>Answer : The truth is existent thing itself.</p> <p>Question : I hope you know the fact that you are in the country which has high spirit and philosophy. Our philosophy taught us that no one is selected.</p> <p>Answer : Hypocrites have made a lot of words and instilled them into people in order to grow their power. Someone spoke about philosophy to me a few seconds ago. The person who questioned should know what he asked about. So after listening to my answer he can confirm whether it is correct or incorrect. Therefore, I will confirm what the questioner asked about. You are using the word philosophy. What do you mean by &lsquo;high philosophy&rsquo;? If you ask questions without knowing, my answer will not match your thoughts at all. Who indeed can answer my question about philosophy in India?</p> <p>Attendance : Philosophy is the way to Truth.</p> <p>Tathagata : Then, what is Truth?</p> <p>Attendance : Truth means that things are in the world is one.</p> <p>Tathagata : Then, I will ask you a question about &lsquo;one&rsquo;. Why do you live?</p> <p>Attendance : One becomes all.</p> <p>Tathagata : What you are saying is too difficult. What is the &lsquo;one&rsquo;?</p> <p>Attendance : The &lsquo;one&rsquo; is inside of everybody.</p> <p>Tathagata : What is it that is in everyone? Explain it in such a way that people can understand.</p> <p>Attendance : It can not be defined.</p> <p>Tathagata : If it can not be defined, that means you are not aware of philosophy. Let me ask a question. What is the answer of &lsquo;1+1&rsquo;?</p> <p>Attendance : Gautama said that an enlightened being wasn&rsquo;t born again. However, you said that you don&rsquo;t know.</p> <p>Tathagata : The meaning of getting a perfect enlightenment is Salvation. Salvation means the state of being free from all Karma. However, I regret to say that I had to be born in this era. In this era, someone had to come and reveal Truth but nobody wanted the work. So I had to be born.</p> <p>Question : Instead of proving your enlightenment, could you explain your philosophical opinion?</p> <p>Answer : I have never told you to believe in me. I am just asking for your interest in things that are in front of you. Then, let me confirm briefly. Is there anyone who knows why you live?</p> <p>Question : You seem to be a liar. In what way can you give conviction to us?</p> <p>Answer : When you see something you see them through your imagination. When I see something I see them through existent thing. The reason why people do not accept what I say is that there is the wall between us which both of us cannot climb over. You gave me a very good question today.</p> <p>Question : Please reveal the truth?</p> <p>Answer : I am revealing things existent things in us. Our conversation is being recorded. Whoever takes this tape and confirms what we talked about with this tape.</p> <p>Question : When are you going to leave this world? Can you live as long as you want?</p> <p>Answer : I will stay in the world for 18 years from now on. I will do my best in order to make eye of human consciousness open. This work will be very important to you. My physical body cannot live forever but my soul can live forever.</p> <p>Question : What does enlightenment means exactly?</p> <p>Answer : Enlightenment means opening eyes to Truth. Easily speaking it means seeing what it is. There are a lot of universities. All the universities teach anthropology. However, no one knows how mankind has been created and changes what process passing through. If I want to know such thing, I am able to know it right now by looking into existent things.</p> <p>Question : What do you mean by &lsquo;special work&rsquo; in this era? And who gave you name &lsquo;one who see&rsquo;, Tathagata?</p> <p>Answer : It is because I opened eyes so I only told you I am the one with open eyes. You should not compare my life with that of Gautama or Jesus Christ. This era is close to changing period and I have to present a hope for you. Mankind has existed through change. In a religion they call such things &lsquo;conclusion&rsquo;. However, I say that such thing must exist in order to make the world itself to exist. As far as you are not aware of things are in Truth by yourself, it will be difficult to understand such thing.<br/>If you cannot believe my words, the only way is confirming. I can answer any kind of question in any area. How many people can explain about any kind of Truth like me? If there is someone who can do so, I want to confirm the fact right now. I came to India for you. This is my love. Whether you can have good results or not is up to your actions and judgement. Since you are not accustomed to Truth, if you compare my words with your thought, nothing will be correct.</p> <p>I will stay in India for a month from now. I hope that I can have chances to meet you again. At that time if you ask your questions more exactly that you are in doubt over, it will be very helpful to you.</p> <p>Thank you for your listening to the end, I hope that you can have blessings</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Imports\nvar ___HTML_LOADER_GET_SOURCE_FROM_IMPORT___ = require(\"../../../node_modules/html-loader/dist/runtime/getUrl.js\");\nvar ___HTML_LOADER_IMPORT_0___ = require(\"./hyde_park_message.jpg\");\n// Module\nvar ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_0___ = ___HTML_LOADER_GET_SOURCE_FROM_IMPORT___(___HTML_LOADER_IMPORT_0___);\nvar code = \"<h3 align=center>SPEAKER'S CORNER, HYDE PARK<br/>by meok kim</h3> <p>On Sunday 24th April 2000, from 12 to 4 in the afternoon, our party was in Speaker's Corner, Hyde Park. Our party put up Tathagata's message board that we prepared and wore tops on which was written \\\"I love you. I have the answers about your life, about your happiness, and about all the help that you need during your life.\\\" \\\"Miraculous medical science. The diseases which can be cured in another way. Where diseases occur and the level of pain can be perceived, if only seen. The diseases can be 100% cured without using any instruments or medicines.\\\"</p> <img align=center src=\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACER_0___ + \" /><br/> <p>Some people laughed at reading the top we were putting on which was written \\\"I love you.\\\" Tathagata shouted out.</p> <p>\\\"I will stay in this world for 15 years from now, and I don't know how many people I can make contact with. The words I have which can give you hope is that things of the world have existed through problems for a long time. If you know a certain question has a certain answer, the fact will be very helpful for your life. The question you are given right now is to know which problem has which answer. Those who follow falsehood will be destroyed. I cannot wait for you in this place forever. I cannot do anything if you refuse to know the truth. If you yourself want the end, I cannot prevent it. First of all, you should confirm if what I say is true or not.</p> <p>You don't have time to enjoy watching comedy or falsehood any more. Now, ask! If you have a curiosity to know a thing. I want you to confirm if I am the man who knows or not.\\\"</p> <p>Person 1 : What is your point?</p> <p>Tathagata : You will be destroyed in the future. The words that the end of world would come in this age are the story handed down through prophecy many times. I have made a lot of effort to prevent this. But I don&rsquo;t have any specific method because people turn away from the Truth and follow falsehood. One certain thing is that there is a changing period after 17 years. A new world is born at that time. Whether you live or you meet a permanent end is dependent on your will. The world has existed for a long time through things in the problems. The important thing for you right now is to think whether you will live or die. There is the way to lead you to the end, or to endless life, in the problem which you don&rsquo;t know. However, I have yet to meet somebody who wants to live, up to now. So I come to this place today as well. I flew 13 hours yesterday in order to be in this place. Now, I want you to ask why I am doing such a hard work.</p> <p>Even though there have been many prophets in this world up to now, none could reveal the truth that people will experience in this age. That's why I have come to this age, and why I am in front of you in this age. You don&rsquo;t have time to enjoy comedy and have no time to waste your life. I would like to say that you still have opportunity, and I hope you take the opportunity to open your eye to things of the world. That is the only way to prevent the end of the world. Now, any brave man who can abandon falsehood and listen to the Truth, stand up and ask. Then you will know I am different from others. I am waiting for your question.</p> <p>One thing which is clear is that every answer is in the problem. But other people don&rsquo;t know the problem. I want you to confirm this point in this place. And if you don&rsquo;t want to live, please tell other people, for their benefit when you go back. &lsquo;A person asked us in this place if we would live or die.&rsquo;</p> <p>Person 2 : How can accidents be prevented?</p> <p>Tathagata : The only thing I can tell you is that a problem always has an answer. If you open your eye a little to the Truth, you yourself can prevent things like accidents.</p> <p>Professional hecklers in speaker's corner, they claimed so, interrupted : What is the Truth?</p> <p>Tathagata : It is easy for me to tell the Truth in this place, but if I tell the Truth you will go away. People have killed those who reveal the Truth in the world. I am trying to reveal Truth and am running the risk of being in danger. If there is one who really wants to save oneself I will tell the Truth in front of them. I will not answer if you are simply asking to slander and harm me.</p> <p>Hacker 1 : Who killed the dinosaurs?</p> <p>Tathagata : Because you do not try to learn the Truth and only try to play, I can not speak to others.</p> <p>Hacker 1 : I don&rsquo;t want to listen to bullshit.</p> <p>Hacker 2 : What happened to the dinosaurs? Answer the question.</p> <p>Tathagata : The word 'love' exists in you, but there is no one who teaches what 'love' is. The word 'happiness' exists in you, but there is no one who teaches how you can obtain happiness, and how you can share that happiness with others. Then who are those who shout out in the world to help others? It can be easily solved, if you see existent thing as a problem. Is there any one amongst you who really loves others? If you say 'yes', I will confirm it. Falsehood is the act of devils, you can never have love with falsehood.</p> <p>Person 3 : How am I able to know the Truth?</p> <p>Tathagata : It is possible if you learn a little. Initially people don&rsquo;t know mathematics. People naturally begin to understand after starting to learn the numbers in school. When you come near to me, and meet 'what is', and listen to 'what is', you will come to open your eye to the Truth.</p> <p>Can a blind person see this fist?</p> <p>It is selfish if you try to see the Truth without learning about things of the world. Many people prophesied that a truthful man would come in this age. I am that truthful man. Only a truthful man can reveal what exists in the Truth.</p> <p>Person 4 : Do you have religion?</p> <p>Tathagata : I never had any religion and have a religion like you. I didn&rsquo;t read books and learn like you. I pay all the expenses to come to this place. I sacrifice everything I have for you. Even if I die I will leave one thing clearly in the world. I refuse religions using my name, and I will tell everyone to learn the fact that problems make answers through the Truth. Learn through 'what is' in the Truth.</p> <p>You may disregard me because I am in this place but I will tell you one thing clearly. &lsquo;Is there any one in the world who can answer my three questions?'</p> <p>I will question very common things. But no one in intellectuals will answer my questions. This is the difference between you, people in you, and I. What is the point teaching things that you don&rsquo;t know to others.</p> <p>Person 5 : Does God exist?</p> <p>Tathagata : Gods have existed while mankind has existed. But Gods do not answer the problem that you want to know. Do you want to see truth or falsehood? If you want to see falsehood you will meet the end. It is the result of falsehood. If you want to see the Truth, you will see endless life. It is the answer that will be in you.</p> <p>Person 6 : Could you tell me if I will be successful?</p> <p>Tathagata : What do you want to do? Explain like a mathematical question.</p> <p>Person 6 : I want to do art?</p> <p>Tathagata : Are you a painter?</p> <p>Person 6 : I am a musician.</p> <p>Tathagata : Why do you think you have to do music?</p> <p>Person 6 : To communicate with others.</p> <p>Tathagata : What can you gain from doing music?</p> <p>Person 6 : I can understand life and enjoy life.</p> <p>Tathagata : How can you understand life?</p> <p>Person 6 : Enjoying the music and I can put my ideas in the music.</p> <p>Tathagata : Are you saying that you live for the music?</p> <p>Person 6 : Listening to music and watching movies as well.</p> <p>Tathagata : I am surprised after listening to what you said. You are living losing your life. If you live like that your soul will not even go to the hell. What&rsquo;s a fool, who want to exchange their life for music. You asked a very important question today. But when you see me next, ask me why you have to live. Then I will give you the answer. If you don&rsquo;t know clearly the reason why you should live it is a very unfortunate thing for yourself.</p> <p>Person 7 : Most people live like that.</p> <p>Tathagata : Most people are not interested in their life because this age is the end of the world. It is silly if you expect that dead sprits will do everything for you, when you yourself do nothing for you. In fact, there are many people who raise their voice in front of you cannot even say a lie if they don't put Gods up. An awful sin is to let yourself live in falsehood. And yet you refuse to know the Truth. You should consider this point when you go back.</p> <p>What I ask of you is to save your life. If you consent, you will turn into an eminent person within 3 years. Furthermore, you will begin to practice big love through what you come to know to the world, you can change your life to endless life through this.</p> <p>Person 7 : Doing meditation or doing what?</p> <p>Tathagata : What I teach is 'What is'. It is the same as somebody who doesn&rsquo;t know mathematics understand mathematical questions learning numbers, you come to open your eyes to 'what is' through learning 'what is'.</p> <p>Person 7 : Can I learn by myself or do I need a teacher?</p> <p>Tathagata : If you learn from me, such a problem can be solved easily. I never lie. But when people do not recognize 'what is', no matter how much they want, it is impossible to speak truthfully.</p> <p>Person 8 : What is enlightenment?</p> <p>Tathagata : To be enlightened means to open ones eyes to 'what is'. Obtaining perfect enlightenment like me is to be able to recognize 'what is' completely. When you come to recognize 'what is', you are able to get everything you want through 'what is'.</p> <p>Person 9 : Osho Rajneesh and the Dalai Lama opened their eyes, but they don&rsquo;t say to follow them.</p> <p>Tathagata : I have visited Osho Rajneesh and the Dalai Lama. I called at their house and their secretaries let them know the fact that I was there, 5 or 10 times. But unfortunately they could not open the door. What do you think the reason was? It was because their falsehood would be revealed.</p> <p>Person 9 : Does that mean they were afraid their falsehood would be revealed, because they don&rsquo;t have truth?</p> <p>Tathagata : That's correct. I can change your destiny. You feel blocked inside now. It means that you have a serious problem.</p> <p>Person 9 : In what way?</p> <p>Tathagata : God has entered you already. If you live in this state continuously, your life will be ruined. Because the god inside you will always try to deceive you, you have to live pursuing ideals. I can solve the problem immediately, if you learn the Truth and if you transfer the correct teaching to future generations for the world. I will not harm the god. If you refuse my suggestion, you cannot live for long. If you want I will change your destiny. If you want I can make you live as much as you want, and I can also make you be born as a prominent person endlessly. I can let you confirm whether such a thing is possible or not. I will show you the proof in front of scientists or doctors who have an excellent brain. Throughout my life I&rsquo;ll never do such a thing that deceives others. I don&rsquo;t get donations from others, and I do this work depending on my ability. If you get into a difficulty, I can give you the ability to solve it. What do you do now?</p> <p>Person 9 : I am a student. I am always working for my life to be better and toward enlightenment. I think God is everywhere. But some people feel it, some people don&rsquo;t feel it.</p> <p>Tathagata : That is the problem that you have. You have to be apart from the God. If I kept company with God, I would travel with my own airplane and would have a comfortable life with many people around me. However, the reason that I don&rsquo;t keep company with God is that the Gods that are in the world exist by wrong life. I am not the person who came to save dead gods, but I am the person who came to this world to save living humans. The only thing that I can do is to help them to come back to the world of life. Only when they are born in the world of life, there is a way to bless themselves.</p> <p>How could I know that you have god? It is that I can see everything. I am the only person who can solve the problem you have. The knowledge that you can learn from university is very small. However, if you learn from me for a short time, you can learn very big things. The important thing is not others approval, but the ability that you have to have.</p> <p>Person 10 : Are there a lot of gods, not only one God?</p> <p>Tathagata : There are as many gods in the world as living people. If gods can help the world, then why is it that people don&rsquo;t know things in the Truth.</p> <p>Person 11 : Because people do not listen.</p> <p>Tathagata : It isn&rsquo;t correct. Gods that exist in the world cannot see the Truth.</p> <p>Person 12 : If a god does not accept other gods, does it mean that gods have ego?</p> <p>Tathagata : If you want to know about the world of God, visit me. Then I will tell you about everything which exists in the world of gods. This man who is here was a leading researcher in Volvo research center in Korea. But he recognized the importance of this work, so he resigned from his job and followed me. Think deeply on what I have told you. I never tell a lie. In fact, only 30% of patients are correctly diagnosed and treated in hospitals, even if they have modern equipment. But I can diagnosis 100% of any person&rsquo;s disease. And if I want I can cure them 100%. In any case, if I hold the soul of a patient who is having an operation, the patient won&rsquo;t die even if the operation goes wrong. This will be revealed one day.</p> <p>Person 13 : Do you want people to follow you and learn to be like you?</p> <p>Tathagata : It is a problem that such a person is very rare. But the situation is better than Gautama Buddha and Jesus Christ faced. Jesus Christ was killed cruelly by people for trying to reveal what is in the Truth. A person like Gautama Buddha died continuously wandering about human society in order to reveal the Truth. I am alive and came here by airplane. I never say to follow me. What I want is your life. What I want is for you to live happily as a wise person. And when an ever better person than me comes to the world, you can go to that person. I don&rsquo;t prevent somebody who comes near to me, and I don&rsquo;t hold somebody who leaves me. I want people to accept the importance of my teaching, but I don&rsquo;t want people to follow and worship me.</p> <p>An acquaintance came and asked to Tathagata with loud voice, \\\"What is the truth?\\\"</p> <p>Tathagata answered \\\"As a person who did not learn the Truth, even if I tell you the truth, will you be able to recognize it?\\\"</p> <p>The person asked to Tathagata playfully, \\\"Can you teach me?\\\"</p> <p>Tathagata answered, \\\"Then be ready to learn, and visit me. Then I will teach you the Truth. You will recognize the Truth if you learn for several days.</p> <p>A hacker said \\\"I'm not rich. I don't have money to give you. I am a poor man. Can you tell me here in this park.\\\"</p> <p>Tathagata replied \\\"Can you teach mathematics to someone who doesn&rsquo;t even know numbers? Do you know mathematics?\\\"</p> <p>The hacker said \\\"What is the relevance between my question and mathematics?\\\"</p> <p>Tathagata answered \\\"The Truth is like mathematics. When you learn mathematics you learn from numbers. In the Truth answers are in the problems. Answers are in the questions in mathematics as well. If you can cause a person to understand mathematics when that person doesn&rsquo;t know numbers, I will teach you the Truth so as to understand the Truth.\\\"</p> <p>The hacker made noise carelessly. Then Tathagata asked the person the reason he lived. He didn&rsquo;t answer the question and made noise continuously.</p> <p>Then Tathagata said, &ldquo;we call a psychopathic one who is noisy without knowing why oneself lives. Jesus Christ was born in Israel in order to make people realize. But psychopaths killed Jesus Christ. The important thing is that you have to prove your words, when you speak. Saying words at random is wrong. Is there anyone who can answer my question around you?&rdquo;</p> <p>People scattered. After for a while Tathagata shouted out again.</p> <p>\\\"There is a changing period within 20 years in this mankind. This changing period will make all civilization and substance disappear. The reason I am in front of you is to discover if you want to live or die. If you want to live, I will tell you the way you can live. Through this message I say &ldquo;I am the one who is truthful, who tells the Truth, who doesn&rsquo;t tell falsehood, and who sees 'what is'&rdquo;. I can tell you the problems of every result that you want. What I want to tell you is the fact that your future is determined by the problems in you. Now, you have to think importantly what you want, and through which problem you can obtain what you want.</p> <p>No one told such a thing until now to mankind. Why do you think I have to do such a hard work in front of you and to be in readiness to suffer all insults. It is to give hope to your life. What I want is for you to open your eye to reality. If you learn about the Truth a little, everybody can open their eye to reality. Things that are in reality will make divide you life and death.</p> <p>The thing that can awaken you from darkness is confirming and learning 'what is'. I do not get anybody's help for this work. I never belonged to any religion since I was born, and I didn&rsquo;t come to you to spread religion. What I want to tell you is to open your eye to the Truth. This will be the most valuable thing for you.</p> <p>Why do you think I am here where comedy is performed? It is because everybody in this age refuses life. Even if you refuse the Truth, when you go back, please tell the people around you that the man who opened his eyes to the Truth has come.</p> <p>I cannot do this work in London forever. If you don&rsquo;t want to lose hope, please confirm about me. If you confirm my words, and the truth of what I have, we will not be the people who are far away.</p> <p>We can confirm everything with the matter in the truth. However, there is no one who knows about the Truth and teaches the Truth correctly in universities or religions. What is the reason there is the word &ldquo;Truth&rdquo; in the human world? It is because when you know the Truth wrongly the fact ruins you and ruins the world. Please put your mind to this point, and think of it as a gift that you came here today.</p> <p>I am going to act for 15 years in the world, and it is not decided where to travel. Before I came to England, I had much hope. But that hope could not be accepted anywhere, so I will be ready to leave this country. One thing surely I can tell in front of you is that I can reveal many facts that no body has been able to reveal till now. Please confirm if I have such ability or not. I ask you kindly for the future of mankind.</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/hyde_park_message.57c4d9c2.jpg\";","// Module\nvar code = \"<div class=post> <div class=post_header> <h3>Tathagata QA while traveling the USA</h3> </div> <div class=post_body><p><span style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Can Mr. Lee tell us a little more about what he does?</span></p> <p><span style=\\\"\\\"><strong>A:</strong> What I usually do is that I like to meet a variety of people, and I listen to them.

During our conversation, if something that I speak doesn't touch in your consciousness, please ask again.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Professor of physics:</strong> Okay, thank you.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I've met lots of people around the world, but because of the difference of our view, I found there was so high of a barrier between us in conversation. Could you understand this example? Numerous people have been born in this world, but among there are very special being can be born into this world. Then, from now on, I would like to ask you what I'm wondering. What is your specialty?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Geodesy. Want me to write it down? It's the study of the shape of the Earth, and the gravitational fields, and the deformation of the Earth.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I wanted to meet a person like you from a long time ago. I have been wondering, how do you understand gravity?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> He means how do modern scientists understand gravity?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> What is the substance of gravity that scientists define?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> For me? I'm not sure what you mean, the substance of gravity. Do you want me to describe a little more?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> The reality of gravity</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> That's a good question. For me, the reality of gravity is the effect of gravity that you can measure on a mass. So, for us, gravity is the force of gravity and the acceleration of gravity. We can measure the gravity field of the Earth with very high accuracy now.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Then I'd like to ask you again, have you learned how has gravity formed and what is the real role of gravity, and how does gravity preserve itself?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> No, that's not my area of expertise. My area is in measuring gravity and gravity changes, but not the&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> The source of gravity</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> The source of gravity, or the&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> How is it vanished</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Yes. Right, why it takes its form. That is not my speciality. And I'm afraid I don't know anything about that either. I only know what's in my field.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> How do you measure gravity?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> We measure gravity by - well, there's a number of ways. That's a big question. The fundamental way is to measure the acceleration of a mass.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Of a mass</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> You know what I mean when I say mass?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, mass.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> It's not easy to measure the gravity by any instruments because we cannot see gravity with our physical eyes. In order to develop the instruments, we need to understand exactly the reality of gravity. When you have any kind of instruments from theories, then it always show us the theory only and the effect of theory. Do you have any new information recently during your research of the surface of the Earth?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> I'm working on some papers now, but the latest way to measure is the GRACE satellite. Are you familiar with this?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes the GRACE&hellip; NASA?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> NASA, yes. So we use that to measure the change of gravity but as you say, we model it, we actually measure the acceleration of two spacecraft and we interpret that in terms of the model that we have for gravity.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> The most important role of gravity is to make the world of the creatures exist.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Exist</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes, essential role</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Gravity has got the real cause of all the creatures.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Okay.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> When a certain regular gravity cause power, then in that situation, very normal the activities of all the creature can keep.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> I'm not sure I understand that.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> The force of the gravity field has got a certain standard or power, then all the activities of all the creatures come.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Okay.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I find it quite difficult to explain about gravity to the scientists.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Yeah, I understand&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> First, modern scientists did not examine closely how has the gravity field been formed - they didn't find the real source (the cause of gravity's formation).</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> That's true. It's an observed phenomenon, but we do not understand why it is there.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Secondly, modern scientists cannot reveal this matter how something what is formed once can keep (preserve) itself without losing them.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> About gravity?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Of course, gravity as well. When gravity is formed once, it's there, how can keep itself?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Yes. The energy&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> And scientists cannot calculate what kind of situation can make it lose itself (disappear).</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> That's correct, as far as I know.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> That's why nobody knows how many hours or how many periods the scientists need to solve the mystery of the world.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Okay, we're working on it.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">*all laughing*</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Some of my information are very essential to understand the future of the world, and all of the matters will be caused by the influence of gravity. I'm not sure, have you heard that recently the temperature of the surface of Earth is increasing?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P: </strong>Yes.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>How do you understand about this matter? What is your answer about this phenomenon?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P: </strong>That's a long question and answer, too. Of course global warming is the typical way people answer it. So I think you're getting at global warming. That could be influenced by external influences (the sun, &hellip;), and also internal, atmospheric influences (greenhouse gasses and such). That's the typical explanation.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Those kind of explanations are because the view of scientists cannot see what is in living reality.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Okay, could I say some things? The view of scientists is based on our observation and understanding. If we lack understanding, that's okay, because that's when we learn new things. But we tie our understanding to observations, always. It's not based on our philosophy but on what we see in nature happen. That's what we base that on. But we may have an imperfect understanding. That's normal. But if someone wants to tell us that we're wrong, they have to produce a new prediction and compare it to data, to observations.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, of course&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Yeah, you're right. We need to examine the matter very closely from the little (simple) system. We need to confirm from the system. If I put my information together, then the claims of modern scientists are quite distant from my conclusion. If we don't solve this issue in short term, then mankind will face the perfect vanish (extinguish). So I sent email to NASA two days ago, but I don't have reply yet.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Who did you email?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> The director of GRACE</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto (secretary, sound engineer):</strong> Yes, from the GRACE research. On the internet, the one with the GRACE project</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P: </strong>Well, they're very busy. They don't return my emails in two days either, so that may be part of it.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> But now we found two person more which we may contact in Stanford.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> But you know, I think that what you're doing now is you're telling your conclusions, you say that the conclusions are different, your conclusions are important, and your conclusions are, I don't know, maybe you call them revolutionary. But no one is going to -- I don't know what to do with that without seeing, not the conclusions, but the reasoning that leads up to the conclusions, and the comparison to data. And the only way to do that is the normal route of publication or presentation at meetings -- meetings like the American Geophysical Union, and the AGU, are open. And there's an AGU meeting coming up in the spring. You can submit an abstract and you can give your talk. But, you can't just say your conclusions. You must say your reasoning, otherwise, you know, I don't trust my own colleagues when they give me their conclusions. Not as a person, you know, I say, okay, prove it to me. I don't know any other way, even visiting NASA. Unless, in a meeting like this, even if we were to have two to three hours, how could you convince someone? If those conclusions are more unusual, the burden and the difficulty is greater.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> We need a kind of system here and we give 30&deg; C heat to one point in space. We have two kinds of ways to increase the temperature on the surface of the Earth: from interior and from exterior.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Yes, mhm.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> In order to increase temperature from exterior by 1&deg; C, maybe 2 or 3&deg; of heat should be given there. If we cannot perceive this phenomenon from the influence of outside, then we should measure from the inside.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> They do measure heat inside, at least they do measure heat flow at the surface, so they do measure the amount of heat that's coming up from beneath, it's called heat flow measurements.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> In fact, it's impossible for scientists to analyze if they don't have perfect instruments to measure and observe the movement of the gravity field. So it's very difficult for scientists to examine that. So we cannot see what happen with our physical eyes in the gravity field, but when the gravity field is cracked, then it influences the activity of the basis of the Earth.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Okay but I don't think a crack in the gravity field has ever been observed. Are you saying we cannot observe it?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mhm.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> So a crack in the gravity field happens but you cannot observe it?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mhm.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> If it has any influence, it must be, at least the effects must be observable.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I haven't learned this situation from the information of scientists now. If we want to understand exactly about this matter, first of all we need to know how does this Earth keep itself forever. But, it will be very few people who can understand if I explain this.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Can I go back a bit? I still am trying to understand are these effects observable or not.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> It's possible to observe in theory. We can make a certain system to observe this. This modern science developed the nuclear bomb. You of course can understand when one nuclear reaction is created, then it divides itself and increases its numbers numerously. Because, in the beginning it's developed very slowly. That's why it's difficult to observe by physical eyes.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> I'm sorry I have a meeting now, but, I mean if you can observe it, then you should tell scientists how to observe it. But if it cannot be easily observed at the moment, then scientists are the wrong people to talk to. Cause we only - we don't change our theories because we want to. We change them because observation indicates that we have to.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> That's not true. Everything in this world has determined. All the results are generated by 'what is' in living reality. If you want to find the secret of this matter, then we just need to pick up only one thing among numerous phenomena. Then it's possible to observe it. Everything in the world which we can see from our physical eyes is applied by only one principle.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Can I ask, I mean I have to leave but what is the goal of coming to talk to the scientists?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Because I hope the science will be able to contribute for the benefit of humankind.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well you must understand the problem then. So he has to publish it. I can't understand the problem at this level.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> When we learn mathematics, the first step is to learn the numbers. When they learn the mathematics without learning the numbers, they have to learn that again.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Then he has to teach us even more. As I said, when it's harder, when it's more unusual, it's more difficult. And if it's going to be so different, then you need to then teach us the baby steps and go back to the baby steps. I'm sorry, I really have to go now.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> We would like to interchange with you, so when you find anything curious or wondering, then please contact us with email.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Okay.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I have not learned by anyone. So if you point out any question (any matter) then I just see what is in your question and I just point out what are in the question.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">Recorded in 2007</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></div> </div>\";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<div class=post> <div class=post_header> <h3>During a discussion with a cognitive scientist</h3> </div> <div class=post_body><p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Tathagata: </strong>Today's science has great development about something that is visible. But they have many mistakes about something invisible.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Professor of cognitive science: </strong>I think I don't quite understand. So...</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Soyun (interpreter):</strong> So, about things that we cannot see through our naked eyes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P: </strong>Right, so, you're saying that the brain makes mistakes, is that what you're saying? I'm not sure I understand what he's saying.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> That's right. Scientists have some wrong understanding about the role of the brain.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> In what way?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I would like to tell you one example. If I compare the brain to the car, then the brain is like a battery in a car. It means that the brain in our body is just like the electric source in the automobile.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Sure.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Because today's scientists are trying to find the role of the brain they try to find out the source of the memory, and the perception, through only the brain. It's difficult for them to find out exactly about that.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Yes, it's very complicated.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> The role of the brain is to transmit, through neural systems, something in consciousness. The brain works to transmit to the consciousness what it learned and saw. It also works to express what accumulated in our consciousness through the brain. We need two parts to observe about how our body recognizes and perceives. So far, the scientists have been observing through only one part.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> It means that only body.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> That's why they failed to find out very correct information about this part. If you have any questions, please let me know.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Oh sure, no that's fine. Yes, so, I actually don't study perception, per se, I study memory.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> You study memory</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Mhm</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, go on&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P: </strong>And what I'm interested in are the molecular processes that are involved in memory.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Would you explain about 'molecular'?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Sure, so, some people study memory as you said, by understanding regions of the brain or the circuits in the brain. We try to go even more basic, to understand the molecules that are involved in certain circuits that are involved in memory.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Our consciousness is composed of energy. And this energy controls our body. In religion, they call the reality of this energy as 'soul'. What we see, what we read, what we learn, all of them accumulate in consciousness. Our brain plays the role to express things that accumulate in our consciousness from outside and they receive the matters from outside and transmit to consciousness. That's the role of the brain.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Right, but I would argue that your consciousness is actually contained somehow within your brain. I don't think it's a separate entity and I think that a challenge of neuroscience is to understand that, how biologically, is the consciousness expressed? Right? It's a very difficult question.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> We need to observe through many of examples. Our consciousness plays the role of a driver of a car.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> That's right. I agree with that.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Our body is no more than the tool of our consciousness.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> I would agree with that also.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> According to my research about religious people, or psychic mediums, and so on, lots of those people live with the third souls (third consciousness). When the other consciousness occupy their own consciousness, their own consciousness become into the state of dormancy. When I met a psychologist, he gave me this question, \\\"Many of people today act on unconsciousness.\\\" So I gave this answer, \\\"When a soul outside invades into another living persons and the soul occupy the other's one, then the own consciousness became to the state of dormancy. That's why we can see many examples that they do not remember what they've done in many case.\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P: </strong>Right, sure, but I think I would always argue that there is a biological basis for all of these observations. Right? So, any change in somebody's consciousness or forgetting previously stored information that there's a biological basis for that.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Everything in the world is run by one principle. When we see all the matters on the principle, we can find all the results and answer from that. But, humans' vision are lack to see the principle. That's why they cannot find answer of matters on the principle. In this case, we need a very simple system. We need a system, and we put matter on principle. So we have principle matter and question. Then we can see the result in the questions. So, I solved all the riddles that humankind couldn't solve so far. I could understand about the behaviors of people (how those behaviors come from certain people). However, it's very, very hard for people to receive this right knowledge. I could find this fact after I finished my research. There are too many people who cannot receive something good even though I really want to give them. If people don't understand this fundamental truth, people will make lots of mistakes in their work. I would like to tell you a very interesting episode (story). When Bush started the war and tried to change Iraq society to democracy, but he didn't calculate one thing. Bush's administration estimated Iraqi people just same as American people. The Iraqi people have Allah, which you don't have in this country. But he didn't calculate this fact, that they have Allah. Allah controls all the gods in Arab. There are numerous spirits who are controlled by Allah, but when they come into human body, then those people are not afraid of death. Because they can conquer human body and control them. Hussein was a tyrant, but he was the child of Allah. But even if Bush tried to give lots of benefit there (money, army,&nbsp; &hellip;) but still Bush is not a child of Allah. If America doesn't understand this fact, America will not get anything from Iraq. It will not finish when America makes Iraq settled. There are other countries around there and they will start to conflict.<strong>*</strong> And all the gods who are controlled by Allah can use others in Arab countries. When you govern this world, all the power is not enough. You need lots of knowledge and understanding. American government don't have this knowledge.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> I would agree with you there.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*all laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If you point out the question (problem) very accurately then I can also answer very correctly. I explain all the things very simply, but this kind of conversation must be your first experience. That's why it will be very difficult for you to listen. When you talk to people like me, you need to know what exists in the organ of consciousness. Everything that were related to us and everything that our consciousness receives becomes to a Motae that makes our life to exist. What is in motae wants that it always act. It doesn't want to stop to act. Here, let's have a very simple case. When a good person has victory, then the evils must surrender. Something evil in ourselves always intrudes that we receive something good. Most of people find it very, very difficult to receive goodness, but it's easy to receive something bad. During my traveling and during my conversation, I sometimes check the dictionary. Some questions which came from children (elementary school boys and girls) and I gave same questions to very higher intellectuals, but they couldn't answer. I thought it was very strange phenomenon. I tried to check on the dictionary. And when I searched their meanings in the dictionary, they didn't explain correctly about them. I haven't found any correct meaning of explaining in the dictionary about some terms something that's really helpful for human's awakening, human's enlightenment, to change their life better. This matter is the evidence that there's no one who really wants to learn something good and no one who really understands something good. I spend lots of time to solve all the riddles in this world. Instead, I became to know about the world what I wanted to know. As the result, I had to lose everything I had. When my level of consciousness went up, my friends around me moved away. Also all my relatives felt very distant of me, and all of my supporters who followed me disappeared. I met some amount of people but most of them are very poor and suffering and has lots of problems in their lives. When they come to me with problems that they couldn't solve through all their lives, they found solution and answers immediately from me. But they never come back to me. So one time was enough for them.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">At that time, I couldn't understand really why those things happened. But now I understand why. During my traveling, I have met so many kinds of people and I have lots of interesting episodes with them. When I traveled India I visited Nehru University. I requested the vice chancellor in Nehru University to introduce some excellent professors in the university and he said that, \\\"Oh, I am one of them. Why not? I want to meet him.\\\" So the following day, I met him in his office and I answered to his few questions. So he asked me, \\\"A man like you who is very unusual, how are you treated in your country?\\\" So I gave him very frank answer, \\\"I'm not a person who is treated well from my country. Even in my home I'm not treated well by my wife.\\\" When he listened to my answer, his attitude changed. He became very humble and he said to me, \\\"I trust what you spoke.\\\" Whenever we visit India, New Delhi, his secretary always comes to us and welcomes us. We cannot say because we have great knowledge we are very welcomed by people. Through my traveling America this time, I have quite good fruit. One interesting thing is that I knew that the scientists in this country had lots of knowledge about gravity because when I read newspapers or from media, they always mention about gravity. But no one knew the reality of gravity now. When I asked them what is the role of gravity on the ecosystem on this Earth, they didn't know anything about that. I asked them how gravity was formed and when. They didn't have any answers. I asked them how gravity that is formed always keep and preserve itself. Nobody knows. When gravity is cracked, what will happen on Earth? Nobody knows. Because they didn't answer, I asked them, Please ask me. But nobody asked me. This is the reality today. During my conversation with the scientists, I could realize what is in reality of gravity. Gravity plays a great role on the ecosystem. When gravity is cracked, all the civilizations of this generation will be disappeared immediately. But they don't try to know the real thing on this. Instead, they always try to on their own hypothesis and write papers,</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P (with a laugh):</strong> That's right&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> And they give a great prize&hellip;. The scientists told me they make photos of gravity through satellites. But from my point of view, gravity cannot be photoed. So their photograph is atmosphere, not gravity. It means that modern science cannot examine the matters that is invisible, exactly.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Some people would disagree with you.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Disagree with you</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> That's right. There is an oriental saying, \\\"Even if you gain all of this world, if you lose yourself, it's useless.\\\" What do you think of this?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well I think you make a very - you think of things more as philosophical and theological whereas I think more as a scientist. So, these questions of mind and the brain are questions - where is the mind in the brain?\\\", or where is the soul in the brain - are questions that I think some scientists would say they can address. Right? By doing experiments.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> They cannot address.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> I think scientists would say that they can. Right? And I think that philosophers and theologians argue that we can't. And so there's a difference of opinion.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I never speak of my imagination, my thought, hypothesis. When I meet some people who don't believe in me, I start my conversation with them under the condition that if 1% of mistake in my words are found in the result, then I'll take all the responsibility of my mistake.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (interpreting):</strong> How much true or how much wrong in what he speaks can be found in only confirmation of the result.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I haven't found any 1% of misunderstanding in my saying so far after my confirmation through all the examples. People don't regard much of my wisdom. But they are quite impressed with my life itself. I don't work much, I always keep traveling. But I don't have any problem in my family. Nothing lack in my living. How about my income? Even though I do same thing with others, but I can make big money in a very short time. I don't have much experience in working - I don't have skills or techniques in working. What I do in my working, the secret to make great income in a short time, I always observe workers and I estimate their capacity, and I always use of their abilities. Whenever I start to work something, I make 10 or 20 times more profit than my competitors. So when I need money, I just go out to work. That's my life. When we know something we can solve all the problems in us by using our knowledge. I wish my life will be contribute for this world. However, I may go back without giving all my knowledge for human beings. If you find that my knowledge is useful to your life, then please let me know. I can promise you that I will not make any 1% of mistake in my answering, so if you give any questions I'll give very sincere answers to you. If I speak like this, people who have no level of consciousness regard me as a crazy man. If I speak something very absurd, and not correct in the result, then I'm a very strange guy. But if what I speak is all correct in the result, then I am a very accurate person. When they listen to me, if they think of me very strangely, then they should ask me, \\\"What is your standard and criteria of your speaking?\\\" But I haven't met any one person who gave this question to me even though they regard me as strange one. Owing to them, I succeed to understand deeper of this world. The geniuses always give great teachings in their agonies. I have excellent knowledge about politics, economy, and management as well. In the future, if we become interested in one another, then you will find a very great benefit in your life. In your academic working, if you need a very great, great paper then please let me know. Within one hour, I can make a great paper that the ordinary people cannot imagine. But in your position, you need about five or seven days to understand about a certain subject that you want to write. We cannot imagine how many years, maybe 10 years, or 15 years, to work down this subject. If your vision cannot reach, however you think over and over, you cannot understand that point. But, if I point of one object, and help you, then you see that. Then you can understand immediately what it is.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">* Recorded in 2007</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></div> </div>\";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<div class=post> <div class=post_header> <h3>Dialogue with a professor of philosophy</h3> </div> <div class=post_body><p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Tathagata:</strong> I have been studying philosophy for a long, long time. So far, I'm not sure if my visiting will be helpful to you or not. I hope we will have a good time. If you have any questions, please let me know. When you do not understand what I speak, then please check again.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Professor in philosophy department:</strong> Okay.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> People in the past regarded philosophy as very, very important study. But people today are so indifferent about philosophy now. I may ask you some questions, but in case you don't know the right answer, don't be so ashamed. It's very important in our conversation to know as the first step what understanding we have in common. That's why I would like to ask you one question before we start our conversation. What is the definition of philosophy of today's scholars? How do you introduce philosophy to others?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> One of the interesting things about this field is that there isn't an agreed definition of what it is. And in fact, it's a philosophical question what it is. In other words, it's a question for philosophy what philosophy is. This is something that, well, philosophers usually wait until they're 60 years old or so to write about. So, I haven't tried to take a view on it, myself.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Haven't you defined it yet (the definition of philosophy)?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Haven't I defined it? No I haven't&hellip; Originally, philosophy was the search for knowledge or wisdom quite generally, but over time, as people have become more and more specialized, branches have broken off&nbsp; so that mathematics used to be part of philosophy, but now isn't, or the physical sciences used to be part of philosophy but now aren't. &nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Good answer. When you visit universities we can see signs to represent the work in university, is that it's the 'house for truth'. The work of the philosopher is to observe a variety of problems and search those matters. University is the place that they search academic research. The purpose of all the studies is to observe and research 'what is' in the problem. When you see this world in a simple way, we can speak about it in a simple way. But if we see this world in a very difficult way, the way of our talking will be always difficult. If people are not familiar to philosophy, even though they listen about something, they cannot understand 'what is' in what they heard. You said that physical science separated from original philosophy, but we should call it as the physical philosophy. Even though politics separated from philosophy, then we just call it as philosophy of politics, or political philosophy. I think myself very easy to answer to all your questions, so do you have any questions during your life so far, and do you have anything in particular that you really want to understand?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> You mean in my academic work, or in my personal life?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Anything. In your personal life, or in your academic research. If you have anything that you really want to understand, then please introduce. When I have your question, I teach you the way to see this world. When you know how to see this world, then like me, when you meet any strangers, you will not be stuck in talking. If somebody is familiar to philosophy, there's no level of question that is something difficult, that is easy. (There's no difference between questions.)</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> There's no difference between easy and difficult questions?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Soyun (interpreter):</strong> Yeah, there's no difference.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Because they're all easy?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> He said that if you are really master of philosophy then the difficulties of any questions are the same. You don't have difficult questions or easy questions.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> How about this one? It's in one of these books.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Oh, Plato.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> The question is, How do people become virtuous?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> To have virtue.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Soyun:</strong> Virtue.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Can this be taught, or trained in some ways, or is it natural?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Soyun:</strong> Taught, or trained, or natural.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Three of things are possible (right answers) to make people virtuous. First, when they have virtue in their 'Motae' (Motae means the real origin), even though they are not taught, they are not trained, they live their life in virtue.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> First is that they have virtue in their motae (in their origin), Motae is Korean but if you want to know, ask him again about that term.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> In order to understand Motae, you need some time. That's why if we have more correspondence (through email or something), then I'll explain enough to understand. In order to understand this term, we need a kind of object and I have to explain about a living example. Today we don't have enough time to explain that. Secondly, people cannot make themselves to be virtuous because they don't know the way how they can change themselves to be virtuous.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> So the second one is way, the path.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Even though somebody commits a very bad conduct, but if they enlighten themselves and when they understand, what is in the knowledge, when they become to know what it is, then they can change their conduct.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Did you get it?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> So if someone understands reality,</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, 'what is' in reality</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> 'What is', if someone understands 'what is' in reality</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Then they can change themselves.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> When you say 'what is' in reality, do you mean when people understand the truth about morality especially, or the truth about 'what is' in their nature?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> It means 'what is' in life. And third, it's possible for them to change good from training. In order to understand this problem (this question) we need to know how our consciousness was formed, and when we know how our already formed consciousness can be changed. So it is possible for us to change ourselves.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> That's why you suggested three things before to change so his answer is that three methods are possible to change - with this reason.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If you are interested really in this matter you need one year to understand this, and you should make questions continuously and have to observe the matter. When you understand properly about this matter, you will be able to be the best philosopher in this modern age. I am talking to you very confidently because, like a mathematician, when mathematician examines exactly the formula and the questions, then they can solve all the questions endlessly. It seems that now I meet a very good friend. If you have interest in me, then I will introduce all the principle how you can solve these matters. When you become to master with all this principle, you will solve all the matters by yourself like me. It's about one month since I started traveling in America. In Los Angeles, I wanted to meet a scientist who had the prize of the best scientist in 2004 in CalTech, but he was too busy so I didn't have a chance to meet him. When I refused to meet him, I started to see about his research (what did he study). I've heard that he wrote a paper about gravity and he was awarded by the paper. I met quite a lot of scientists who study gravity in several universities in America. Now I became the best one who knows of gravity in this world. Through several meetings I could see through them what they know. And I became to see things that they cannot perceive. In order to give evidence to others, we need to show others through a system, and we have to let people to see 'what is' in the matter. This is evidence. No scientist in America could show me the reality of their claims. Instead, I became to be able to show all the reality to them. I told you this episode (this story) for example. What Plato said in that book, could you give me another question? I'm very interesting.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> So, other questions?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes, or in another book, you have lots here&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well, let me follow-up on the question I already asked. Is it possible for someone to have knowledge of 'what is' but not be virtuous, or does knowledge guarantee the virtue?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> We need two dimensions to see the knowledge of human beings. One is natural. When we come to the world, we already have them in us. The other dimension of knowledge is that which comes from education (learning). We never show something through our behavior which is not in ourselves. So people can be a virtuous one only when they learn in case if they don't have that in their nature. We can find very interesting things when you study of Motae. It's almost impossible for the bad people to learn good, because something inside in them refuses. That's why it's very, very difficult for evil nature to receive good things. When we study this object, then we absolutely need the concrete object or matters so that we can observe and understand. In the world of math, we start from number 1, but we can make the endless number. In this world, we have numerous phenomena. We can solve all the questions by one principle. That's why in learning philosophy and teaching philosophy, the most important thing is the principle. But I haven't met anyone who wanted to learn this principle or who can teach this principle through any books, through anybody. If somebody becomes to know this principle, something bad in them will be disappeared. And from that time, good thing become to accumulate inside of them. Meanwhile, if somebody who doesn't have goodness in them but they want goodness to accumulate in them, then they must fight against 'what is' in themselves (in their Motae). And they must win. So what I speak is not mine. When you study our history, there's no one who really wanted to learn from the really excellent teachers.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> When you have really great teacher, nobody really wanted to learn from them.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> In short introduction, our generation has four great greatest teachers. All of them were great philosophers. Through their teachings, we can find them, first was Gautama Buddha. He obtained (gained) a great Enlightenment and became to open his eyes to the world. When he was Enlightened, he tried to teach people goodness. But, people didn't come to him to learn in particular. That's why he was wandering the world until his age of 82 and he was looking for people who wanted to learn something good.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well I'm surprised he says that because there are so many stories about him talking to the great assembly of thousands of people...</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Thousands of people</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> The assembly of all the Bodhisattvas&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*As Soyun translates, Tathagata laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If there were people who wanted to listen to him, why he had to travel until 82 years and died on the street?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">The second was Laotzu in China. Laotzu didn't learn much from others but he became the greater philosopher from what was in his Motae. He saw things in the world and when he tried to let people know what he saw, nobody came to him to learn. He was wandering all his life to find people but he had to die without any one disciple. Third, is Jesus. As soon as he opened his eyes to the world, he was killed by people before he taught his teaching properly to others. Fourth was Socrates. Socrates tried to let people know something good that he saw. But he didn't have students. He tried to introduce people what life they wanted, and he wanted to introduce how something good and bad happens in this world. But he didn't find any students. There's one person, Plato, who was interested in him, so after that he tried to introduce this teaching to others. I was very popular with people around me before I became a great philosopher. But when I became to open my eyes to the world, nobody come to me. That's why I had to start my traveling because I expected that my knowledge would be helpful to people in this world. (I'm looking for people.) I always requested them please ask me, but nobody ask me. And I always tell them, \\\"I can show you what you want to see.\\\" But nobody requests me, \\\"Please show me.\\\" This is the story of this world now. If you become to know about philosophy a little more, then you will understand why this thing happens in this world. I have only one thing to tell you. I don't have what I know, I don't have what I don't know. I become to know when I see the problem. But I don't know before I see problem. This is me. That's why I don't say that I know something or I don't know anything to people before that happens. But I don't have people who has interest in me especially.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Are you not students?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> It took a few decades to gain these few members. But you know, students come here with money to learn. I say am a greater philosopher, but if students come to me, when they don't have money I have to support them. This is difference. Sometimes people visit me. Most of them are poor, and very hardships. Sometimes the people come to me with their suffering and they ask me what is in their life. They have answer from me. But I haven't experienced that my answer were wrong. I believe that I give you correct answers to any kind of your questions because I can see 'what is' in your questions. So don't think of my circumstance. Whatever you are wondering, then please let me know. If I'm stuck to give answer to your questions then I'll invite you for dinner. Then you win the best. It's impossible for all the scholars in this world to compete to me. That's why I am very, very careful when I meet you. Because people find it very difficult and boring to listen to something that is outside of their vision. But I'm not sure you understand what I speak or not, but you could stand 50 minutes now.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Long time&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> That's why I would like to do something for you. So if you want, then I will solve any problems in your health or problems in your family, in your future, anything. Or problems in the society, you can ask me anything.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Can you offer a way to find peace in Iraq? The way to solve this war and violence&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> It's very simple. In order to answer to this question, you need to show me what problems is in Iraq. There are lots of problems in Iraqi society. And all the answers of those variety of questions are different. If you ask me 1,000 questions about that issue within 10 minutes, then I'll answer to all your questions in 10 minutes. And I'll take responsibility of all my answers. When a mathematician has a mathematical problem, he will solve the problem on the formula. So if he finds the wrong answer, then it's the mistake of the mathematician. First, we need to recognize what is the problem in Iraq society. It's very easy for a person like me to solve the problem because all the answers are in their questions (problems). There are many of problems in this world and modern society is controlled by politicians. If there are some politicians who really want to be settled (peace in Iraq), then I would like to meet them and I'll help them to give this in Iraq's society. Meanwhile, I will not give solution to them if they have their own way of peace. If some people give me the authority (power) to govern Iraq, then I'll make the country to be peaceful within one month. In this world, nobody asked me about that, then how could I stand up and tell them I can make Iraq to be peaceful in this way. (I cannot say that&hellip;) You need quite time to understand the living reality.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Yes, of course&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>What is your wish? Don't see me as the ordinary person. If you tell me your wish, then at the moment your wish will come true 50%. But you will obtain 50% through your effort. I can promise this to you. You might never have met anybody who speaks like me. And nobody can tell you (like intellectuals) nobody can speak like me in front of a person like you who is intelligent. You'll be treated by people as an intelligent person when you mix with any people, they will say, \\\"You are intelligent. You know something.\\\" I never ignore you so don't misunderstand that I speak very freely in front of you, because I'm very curious to you. I have lots of abilities the ordinary people don't have. I am always traveling around the world with no special sponsors -- individuals nor organizations don't sponsor me. I always travel but I don't work, but I always prepare my all expenses for my traveling. I don't have any problem in my family. This is quite different from others. It's impossible for me to make you understand in such a short time. I will appreciate to you if you ask me about things in the world if you want to know things in the world, or things in the future, things in yourself&hellip; please ask me then I'll appreciate that.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">Recorded in 2007</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></div> </div>\";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<div class=post> <div class=post_header> <h3>Tathagata meets a professor</h3> </div> <div class=post_body><p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Soyun (interpreter):</strong> Let me introduce Mr. SamHan Lee, and these are members of our society. Mr. SamHan Lee says, \\\"I am very pleased to meet you.\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Tathagata (Mr. Lee):</strong> The brain is one of my specialities. Maybe I am too philosophical so if I talk with people sometimes people find it very difficult to talk to me. I'm always ready to take any responsibility of what I speak. If I speak something wrong, I'll take all the responsibility.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Professor:</strong> I see. That's good.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Many times we experience very hardship during our lives. One of the cases is that when we contact something new that we don't understand before. I speak people usually the most difficult time is that you start to learn something very new for the first time. My real specialty is that what influence of what is in the present living reality to the future.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> No one can know the future&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Not always&hellip;. When you understand, we can know everything in the world is determined. And the future is created by the problems (matters) in the present. If we have something wondering, please try to confirm how do I answer. The mathematician always uses the same formulas for the same type of questions. And they can solve all the questions from very small number to very large number by one principle. During this traveling I have met many scientists. Most of scientists have been trying to experiment and test without the correct principle about their research. It's very, very hard to see this world without any principle.&nbsp; So I tried to teach them how they can see easily about what they want to find out but they didn't like it.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> I don't understand why&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> You share with us a very precious time, so if I keep my talking I feel sorry for you. If you have any interest and some problems that you want to solve or find out, then why you don't you share us?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> When you ask how people do science, there's really no answer. People decide that a problem is interesting and they try to figure out how to understand it. But there's no set of principles or method, just a kind of&hellip; What we've learned from, you know, there was one scientific revolution, basically Galileo -- the idea was to idealize away from -- Aristotle could explain everything, he had an answer for everything. But nothing was explained well. And Galileo said look at something contained, try to explain that well and you can radiate out and explain more and more and more. That's a kind of working principle, but I don't know any other principles&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I usually meet some scientists who are researching environmental problems, global change, and the subject of gravity.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Gravity is what changed the way you understand the world, because prior to Newton, the belief was that the universe was mechanical, that there had to be pieces of everything, like a machine. What Newton showed is that you could have action at a distance, that things didn't have to touch one another, and there could be effects without any kind of contact. Newton thought it was crazy -- his own idea. It seemed mystical that could be something here and something there with nothing connecting them, so we start looking for what could be aether connecting them, little dots connecting them, then there was nothing connecting them. Basically, what Newton was able to show is that our commonsense was irrational, and that we had to throw away all this mechanical junk, and try to have theories that we can understand. It's an amazing change in the way we looked at the universe.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Yes, it was a great discovery at that age, but Newton didn't explain much in detail about gravity.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> No, he didn't but that was a few hundred years ago. It's clear that there are things that we don't know about. For example, most of the universe is occupied by black matter and we don't know what it is. That's a pretty amazing idea that after all these years there's this whole area that we can't even show what it 's made out of. That's a pretty wild idea.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I thought scientists already know about gravity, because many people say about gravity.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> The mystery of physics is trying to put together quantum mechanics on one hand and relativity on the other hand. They don't form a unified theory and that's the goal, to form a unified theory.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> However no scientist really knows what is the source of gravity -- how is gravity formed (generated)? And nobody has a close examination about the matter of how does gravity keep itself after they formed?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> There's lots of questions one can ask, but we can't always answer them.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> They don't guess or expect which conditions can make gravity be cracked.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> You know, there are lots of problems, no doubt about it&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> They also didn't have any examination about what is the real role of gravity.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Oh, what puts the whole thing together.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>So I wanted to give my information (knowledge) and plans but still I cannot find the best way for that.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> There are a lot of questions to ask&hellip; But it's not clear that there are answers to all the questions. Human beings don't have unlimited possibility to understand what's around them. They're not angels.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto (secretary):</strong> You mean they have limitations.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Oh yeah, they can understand some things but not other things.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> This morning we visited the Earth science department. We found all the scientists are too busy so we couldn't find any way to give our information. And they will not see forever the really important things. So you know, if somebody really starts to understand about the field of their studies then from that time they don't have something to do. I'm proud that my society has better knowledge and information of life sciences than NASA or any institute in America. In spite of our excellent information and knowledge, we don't find anything to do, that's why we keep our traveling and we try to see what happens in this world. You may use this very, very funny episode when you meet others; maybe you can court with this episode. There are many people who make a big queue to learn from somebody who really doesn't know. You know, somebody who really doesn't know is always trying to teach others and they struggle to teach others without their understanding of what they teach.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P: </strong>That's a way of looking at the world. The way we work in this department is that we have the faculty and students but they intermix and often the ideas come from both ways. It's not that we teach them what to do, they often teach us what to do.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> You are really qualified to be a professor. We haven't met the professors who speak like you. We have visited so many universities around the world, but we often found very good students, but not so good professors.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> A lot of scientists don't think so much about how they do something or underlying principles, but because of Chomsky in our department, he thinks a lot about these things. He spends a lot of time thinking about questions of philosophy of science. And I think that influences the rest of us in this faculty.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>I am very interested in meeting with him. I am very interested and wondering what he can see from his knowledge.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> He's written a number of books.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> It's not so important to write books. The important point is how much the content in books can contribute to people in society. I've got three terms that I can listen even from children. My son, when he was in elementary school, asked me these questions. In case I have a chance to meet Noam Chomsky, then I would like to ask him about these three terms. If he knows about these and if he can give me one of the right answers, then I will be his slave for the rest of my life. We will knock at his office this afternoon but I don't expect much because he must be very busy.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well he's pretty hard to come by. He has speaking engagements for three years ahead of time&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If some people who really know, they don't need much of languages. They only need to prove the truth of their words. And I can show all of evidences that I speak the truth to his questions. You will not prove anything that he can see the truth from his words. It is not so important for human beings that how much they have respect from others. The most valuable thing is that how much we are truthful. Any kind of teachings doesn't have any value if they don't have truth in them.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> The truth&hellip; you gotta be careful there. Being truthful is one concept, but scientific truth is a totally different concept. This is the notion that or theory about what is true about the universe, and in that sense there is no scientific truth, or if there is, there it sort of pretends to. Well, many people think now that what scientists do, the goal of science, is to come up with theories that are comprehensible. Whether or not they're true about that world out there is something we can't know. And the more we work with more complex systems like the human mind, the less we can make any claims to truth. What we can have is comprehensible hypothesis. But truth is a totally different thing. And being a truthful person is a very different concept.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> People should prove the truthfulness in their words if some people who cannot understand what they speak.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well, your work has to be honest&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If we view the science and philosophy separately, it seems very distant. But when you see in the same way, the philosophy and science, they are like the two sides of one coin.</p> <p/> <p>&nbsp;</p></div> </div>\";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<div class=post> <div class=post_header> <h3>Meeting at a climate research funding organization</h3> </div> <div class=post_body><p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Tathagata:</strong> I am very concerned about the future of this world. Today's scientists cannot find exactly what will happen from this climate change in this world. In this moment the most serious thing about this issue is not climate change, but the more important thing is that there is a change of the temperature of the surface of this Earth. In order to solve this riddle, we need to start to check from the activities of the gravity field. However the scientific world uses very frequently the term of 'gravity', modern scientists do not find what is the role of the gravity to the ecosystem, and secondly, how the gravity was formed. How does it preserve itself? And what circumstances (situation) occur the crack of gravity field? No scientists want to know this truth, or no one knows about this fact. Scientists only check about the pressure in the atmosphere by experiments of collision. But it's impossible for them to reveal the substance of gravity. This is the most serious matter at this moment. The crack in the gravity field has already started. Because of this crack, the activities of inside of the Earth has started. As the evidence of this activities, people find that the temperature of this Earth are increasing. I can explain about this by, finally, cases. For example, we have energy power in our body and energy controls our body and support our activities. Gravity is just like the energy in our body but it's for the Earth. We cannot see gravity with our naked eyes. But the power of gravity is really essential for the activities of all the living creatures. When the power becomes weak, the function of immunity becomes to lose.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Soyun (interpreter):</strong> Now, he explains to compare to our body the energy because the gravity of Earth is like the energy in our body, so we have very weak energy in our body then they can't make the new cells.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Tathagata:</strong> In this case, our body becomes very weak and we cannot protect ourselves from disease, and it's possible for the living creatures become to die. The role of gravity is just like the energy (power) in our body. If you see this Earth from our widened vision, the Earth is like a model body of living creatures. So when you study about the environment, and ecological climate issue, then the first point should be studying from the gravity problem. Some scientists claim that the global warming is from greenhouse gas. And this gas also has power to neutralize the power of gravity. That's why it doesn't exist, that scientist's claim about global warming. I wanted to tell these facts to American scientists so I have been traveling this country for one month. But I couldn't find any one American scientist who really wanted to know about this matter. Things in the world is just like the matter in mathematics. When you observe one matter, we will find different characters when the problem change. So when you study about global warming, we cannot solve the real problem without understanding the substance (the reality) of living creatures. The most dangerous enemies in saving this world are modern scientists. The causes of global warming and all pollutions confront modern civilization. Modern civilization has broken the balances of the natural world. The result is that it causes the creation of gravity to stop. And what happens from the result that the creation of gravity is stopped? Then we need a very simple system to prove this. My information is very, very important. I would like to give my information to some people who really love this Earth, but in case if some bad people have my information, it will cause something disaster. This world lets all the phenomenal world to exist by using the problems. That's why if somebody has the view how they can see this world by principle and problems, then anybody can change the destiny of this Earth. That's why I'm traveling to find out good scientists. If I could have met good scientists, I wanted to discuss about how we can create water and air outside of this Earth. In fact, this is possible if we have some experiments. But because I couldn't meet any good people, I'm going back two days later. I didn't come here to fight against the scientists. The scientists only have read the books that others wrote, and they always have very abstract ideas. I haven't mentioned even how the scientists and the scientific world in this world is so ignorant before I started this traveling. If you have any questions, please ask me.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> So as I understand it then, the goal of your visit was to find a scientist to do experiments that show the relationship between gravity and CO<sub>2</sub> and the effect on temperature.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Yes. I wanted to cooperate with them. And secondly, I wanted to understand what today's mankind really wants. I would like to explain in short why I could speak like this. Most people have already known what I wanted to speak now. Inside this earth there's the level of heat. Heat creates the other materials, and by using the materials the heat created, it also keeps itself. When some kind of problems happen in the gravity field, these materials inside of the Earth start their own activities. In some cases, it only causes climate change. In this case, we can compare it to just we have a flu (catch a cold). But the most serious case is that the heat level creates the kind of core that according to the time that passes, the core what is created starts to work to increasing itself. And by increasing itself, the temperature on the surface is increasing. I can explain with this case. When somebody has a kind of disease and if he becomes very ill, the body temperature becomes increasing. Our normal temperature is 36&deg;C. But when they are very seriously ill, our temperature becomes 39&deg; or more. Then the doctors say that the patient is in the circumstance of danger. At the moment we have 1&deg; of increasing of the temperature on the surface. So it is not so harmful to the ecosystem. But when the core that is created makes the number increase then the temperature will go up 2 or 3&deg;. We expect that what happens in this earth from the effect of this temperature, then this Earth cannot stand the pressure. So it will become to escape as volcano. This is the first symptom - earthquakes, or volcanos. If it becomes more serious, it will cause crustal change. In this case, there will be tremendous tides from the flow of the sea. There is the possibility that the big tides may go 1000 meters high. In this case, from these waves, all civilizations on this Earth may be disappeared. This is not so good phenomenon that all this information become known to others. But if there are some people who feel that they are very responsible of these kind of symptoms they should help to solve this problem. Unfortunately, I haven't met good people yet. And no government supports me to research this matter. Fortunately I have the best knowledge about life science. That's why I could solve all the riddles of this Earth by pursuing the origin of all the creatures. I hope our meeting will be helpful to this world. If you have any questions, please let me know. If my answers are going to be stopped by your question then now I'm telling a lie. But if I'm not stopped by your questions, I am speaking the truth. What I'm speaking now and all of my answers, it's not possible to come from any books and from people's thought. During my traveling, sometimes I spend my time to check out the explanation of the terms in the great dictionaries. In many cases I found out they didn't explain properly about the meanings of the terms. That's why it's impossible for people to find out solution through the books. Moreover, it's impossible for anyone to solve this kind of problem by very small part of experiments. NASA claims that they will reveal soon about the substance of gravity. But this morning we also contacted the people in NASA. But we found that they were not really interested in research of gravity fields. They always develop and make all the theories without correct grounds. It's impossible for them to understand the real substance of the gravity by experiments of collision or pressure of air. Now, I start to doubt about their true color after meeting with them. Their research will not be helpful at all for the future of mankind and help people to exist in this Earth. There is one secret in this world. Some people who never done anything good never receive good people. They (people who have never done anything good) are very clever to use their brain to do something bad. According to our research, those kinds of people don't have 0.1 cm of view about something good. You will not believe but we can find all the evidences in any places in the phenomenal world to confirm what I speak now. There's no creatures who can receive something that they don't have in themselves. According to my calculations, if we let scientists to solve this problem, then this world will be extinguished (ruined) within 10 years.* When they listen to me, they always demand me to send any paper evidence, or report. In case we cannot confirm with our naked eyes, we can use a kind of system to confirm all of them.The ground of my claim is that everything in this world keeps its change by one principle. That's why if we make any system by using what is in this principle, it makes us possible to confirm anything. However, the existing authorities don't want to receive the information to keep their own power. This is the biggest problem at this moment. Yesterday I visited one university and somebody asked me, \\\"Where did you get your Ph.D degree?\\\" If there has been somebody who could give me this information (knowledge) then this mankind haven't faced this all kind of problems now. I told him, \\\"No geniuses had degree from others. But the genius never tell a lie. All the evidences are in this world itself. It is possible for us to confirm all these evidences in anywhere in the world. I only suggest my evidences in front of some people who have intention to check out those evidences.\\\" When I told this to him, he asked me of his specialty and where our body power comes from. So I answered to his question, \\\"Where does the power of a car come from?\\\" And he told me, \\\"Gasoline generated the power of the car.\\\" The human body absorbs the energy when we eat food. And by using the power (energy) we generate power in our body. We need two points of view to observe this. One case is that we use lots amount of gasoline for cars, but there's not so much power generated. But some cars generated a big power from a small amount of gasoline. The cause of these two differences was in the engine of the cars. We just compare it to a car - our bodies are different. Some people's body can generate lots of power and energy from a small amount of food. Some people are different. Even though they have lots of food, they generate only small power in their body. It's a difference. We can solve this world problem very easily when we see in the simple way but if we make it very complicated in the way to see the world, then it's very very hard to understand the way of this world. If you doubt or need more explanation about what I told you, then please let me know.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Well I'm not a scientist, so I'm not here to try to disprove or approve of the ideas and theories about the effects of gravity in the larger global climate. If it's true, it's even more depressing to me. Because we already know that the technology we have emits greenhouse gasses, but the effect of that, there's already climate change that occurs from technology and progress, so if there is additional impact from gravity, then the consequences are only going to be much more severe. So that is on top of what we already do. What we try to do here in supporting the research is we understand that what needs to be done has to be done at a very, very large scale.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> You mean the scale of supporting?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Yeah, if we want to somehow make a change, a change in behavior, or a change in our transportation, or how we consume power, or how we consume energy in any way that emits greenhouse gasses, it has to be widely adopted. You know, just me changing my behavior won't have a big impact on really changing the temperature of the world. So you need the millions of people to change their behavior, or how they consume energy, how they move, how they transport themselves.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> So your suggestion to protect the people to this serious environmental problem</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> My point is that if something needs to change, somehow, whether it be energy, it needs to happen on a very, very, very large scale.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Then there's hope (possibility).&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Yes, sure, there's hope. But we don't know what's gonna work. So, we try to look at a lot of different ideas.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> There are many, many environmental movements and many people are engaged in the movements, but they have wrong point now. It's true that greenhouse gasses influence the environment. It's very easy for us to confirm this. All the materials have their own nature. They always fight against something that is not similar. The gravity power (energy) fights against greenhouse gas, and there is a rule: the stronger eat the weaker. So when the gravity power is stronger than the greenhouse gas, then it eats that one, and then the greenhouse gas will become absorbed in the gravity's power. Like some scientists' claims, if there is a 1&deg; increase in temperature of the surface of this earth there will cause great change in this ecosystem. I haven't read any article naming a certain reason there are numerous living creatures that suddenly died (disappeared) because of this climate change. I don't say the scientists don't have grounds of their claims, but they exaggerate too much. That's why when I listen to their claims it seems like I'm reading a novel (fiction). Because of greenhouse gas, a little bit of gravity power can be destroyed. In the future, if you need me then if you send your problems exactly, what is your problem (question), then give me some materials of your research, then I will analyze very exactly what is in your issue. I'm very sorry because I didn't meet your director, today. If she might be interested in me, I could give very good information for your research. I am pleased to meet you because you gave us your time, I have a chance to tell you some of the truth. The phenomenon always existed in the past mankinds as well. When civilization developed, this result always happened to those generations. I have quite knowledge in physics and very excellent knowledge in life sciences' part. During I'm living on this Earth, when you need me, then please contact me, whatever, I will try to help you.</p> <hr/> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> During this traveling we have visited ten universities. But we didn't have so good result. Stanford University is the last course of this traveling. Now we left only four hours to work there. When you have any questions, even personal things, please ask me. Please test me if I can solve some questions or not. If I cannot solve it, that's just fine, nothing lost. But if I can solve, then it's very big for you. Or when you try to write a paper, if you find something that you cannot understand, please ask me. When you give me a question then you should point out very exactly what matter do you want to see.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto (secretary):</strong> So that's our cellphone here in the US in case you can contact, maybe today, if the director wants to meet us.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> He has meetings today, unfortunately, but I'm afraid I won't be able to properly relay your message, so if you have written down anything about your ideas, then I can forward it to them. Because I don't know if I can express those ideas properly, but if he has written any sort of summary of your ideas, I can&hellip; It doesn't have to be scientific, just a summary.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> When I was in England, London, I visited Nature, the scientific magazine, to inform this matter to people. When I met the editor in chief at the magazine, he demanded me to write a paper.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q: </strong>Oh I didn't mean published. It doesn't have to be published, just&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> No, no&hellip; he is explaining about writing&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Soyun:</strong> He tries to explain about writing...</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I asked him, \\\"If I write a paper, then could you understand what I speak?\\\" And he answered that, \\\"We have lots of high intellectuals around us.\\\"&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">\\\"Then I want to confirm first, and later I'll write papers for you.\\\" I told him, \\\"I would like to ask you one thing, and please answer to my question.\\\" I asked him, \\\"What is the criteria of good writing and bad writing?\\\" But he became mad and he thought for a long time, but he said that it's too difficult a question. Even though I write a very good paper, but if you do not understand what I write, then it's useless. I wouldn't write anything very important and provide you all the information in writing when you don't have eyes (view) to understand them.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">* Recorded in 2007</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></div> </div>\";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \" <div class=post> <div class=post_header> <h3>Economy talk at Tathagata's hotel accommodation during Thailand travel, 2004</h3> </div> <div class=post_body><p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Question from member: </strong>With money, or with enough money, even yesterday, we could have arranged an interview with the big, big monk and the American translator; If we give a donation and we ask if they have enough time, it's \\\"Oh sure sure, please, please come.\\\" But I have no money, but I'd like to be your patron. So, to be your patron, I need to get my hands on some money. Now, I've been thinking, well, I'd like to try to do that by writing a book. And, I'd like to use the book to give mankind a message, my own message. But there's things that I need to know before I can actually write the book. Now, the story itself, the book itself, I'd like it to be allegorical&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Soyun (interpreter):</strong> Allegorical?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q: </strong>Allegory. It means, it works on two levels. So you've got the normal story and then I'd like to have my characters all represent different things, and then use these characters to tell a story to humanity. Now, my central character represents humanity itself, mankind, and where the book begins, is that he's committed suicide. And basically what I'm saying is that mankind, this modern mankind is finished. So, as he's about to die, he remembers how he actually got to that point. And so, it starts there, it goes back here and then he tells a story about how he got there. Now, the book itself is a book of three parts. And in the first part, he has a normal life, or, a life. And then, something happens to him, and Tathagata's in the book, right, that's why I can't actually finish it, because I want Tathagata to tell me what he thinks, if he wants to put anything in the book himself. So, what happens is, my character is going to work, and Tathagata is there, and I got the idea from the sign. And basically, he says to my character, to humanity, \\\"Why don't you go that way?\\\" And my character's going to work, doing normal life, and he says, \\\"No, no, no, I'll go that way\\\" and then Tathagata says, \\\"Are you sure? Maybe you should go that way, it's better for you.\\\" and humanity says, \\\"No, no, no, not gonna go that way.\\\" And then, well, we're gonna be here a while.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto: </strong>But she has to translate.

Food problem will be very serious.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata begins to explain*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> So, His simple idea is that we buy big land in Australia, or Canada, or Malaysia, or Borneo Island, and we set up a company.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> When we make a foundation for agriculture, then after three years, we have income from that. Year by year, our income will increase. Most of the people in the world neglect agriculture, this is just a primitive industry. That's why this is a very good opportunity. This is also one reason that I have a long-term visa is Malaysia. Australia also has good land.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> The actual dirt itself, the soil, is very poor.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Soil is poor.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Yeah, the topsoil.

Farming's done, but we've got a problem with rising salinity and acidity of the soil.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> We'll finish all this travel one and a half months and after that we will concentrate about business to make income.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> What is the cause of that there is going to be hunger, or there's not going to be food?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> This world is full of the wave of industrials. Huge lands developed into industrial areas. They use land for building housings, and roads. They are the causes to make shorter the farming land. China is exporting food at 20 million tons per year. But next year, they produce food just for themselves. Vietnam, and Malaysia, Thailand, they still export food. But these countries also make shorter the farming land.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> The soil itself is less productive?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> No, they change to industrial&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> From next year, the price of the grains will increase.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Soyun: </strong>From 2005.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> And in 2008, the price will go up very quickly.

My intention was to help the university &ndash; to help the university function as best&hellip;&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>You mean the ________ [redacted] University.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> The ________ University.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>So when you come to Thailand you had intention already.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> No, I had intention to learn more about Buddhism, try to apply Buddhism to world problems. I mean that was my very general intention. I really feel that Buddhism could be very useful to solving world problems.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>People can be deceived by themselves when they don't understand correctly about something. If Buddhism receives Buddha's teaching and teaches what Buddha taught, then it's absolutely helpful for people's life. But in the modern Buddhism, I couldn't find any one anywhere to accept the Buddha's teaching and give Buddha's teaching for people.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well the teaching is so basic &ndash; it's such a basic teaching, and so universal &ndash; that people overlook basic and universal, they want smaller things, they look at closer things&hellip; they don't&hellip; it's very hard for most people to look at the very basic pure teachings of a spiritual leader. I&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Yes. It's very hard for people to receive good teachings.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Mm.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Because of the difference of the point of view (the angles), it's very hard for anyone to see the truth.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well the&hellip; I just wanted to mention something in the&hellip; his&ndash; your brochure. The question &ndash; the most basic question you can ask yourself is, Who am I? and that&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> It's in the brochure&hellip; One of the teachers I respect very highly, Stephen Bachelor, a Buddhist teacher from England, he left Tibetan Buddhism, went to Korea, and studied for 3 years there in a temple, and they gave him one question to deal with, \\\"Who are you? Who am I?\\\" And he asked that for 3 years.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> So, you know I think that's the most basic question, and people don't ask that of themselves, and they don't understand, so when they come to a basic teaching, how can you understand a basic teaching if you don't understand who you are?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>In mathematics, when we see figure 1 (number 1), we just understand that is 1. When I ask to myself, who am I? then I is myself. Soyun,</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>I am Soyun.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Soyun was deceived for a long time by a high monk (higher monk)&hellip; In Korea, he was very famous monk (very, very famous, very high position monk),&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (interpreting Tathagata):</strong> So I went him to learn something. So his first question to me was that Where is your mind?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Where is&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Your mind</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>\\\"Where is your mind?\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Where is your mind.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> The mind,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S, Satto:</strong> \\\"Where is your mind?\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>So I was very embarrassed (Soyun was very embarrassed at his question). So, after many years later, I met (Soyun met) Master Tathagata and Soyun asked him the same question, \\\"Where is your mind?\\\". So,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>I pointed out the light and&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>So Master Tathagata light off and asked to Soyun, \\\"Where is the light? (Where is the electric light?)\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>When you switch on, there's light. When you switch off, there's no light. And Master explained to Soyun, \\\"Mind is the same.\\\" The light is generated from the electric generator and the mind is generated by what is in consciousness. And Master Tathagata told Soyun, go to the monk again and tell him, \\\"I found my mind.\\\"&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>And he guided &ndash; Master guided me if the monks asks me, \\\"Then, where is your mind?\\\" \\\"Soyun, go to him and pinch very strong his leg\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> What an experience&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>And he was (the monk) was very frightened and *Soyun laughs* asks Soyun, \\\"What are doing??\\\" And Soyun told him, \\\"Oh, I showed my mind to you.\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> It's a very basic teaching in Buddhism&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata begins to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Mm&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Mind expressed from our behavior. Because mind is expressed through our behavior, we can see others' mind from their behavior. This is very easy question, \\\"Where is your mind?\\\", but the people in general never can answer.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> There's a very famous koan in Japanese Zen Buddhism, \\\"What was your face before you were born?\\\" You know, what is behind your conditioning before you born?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Before you were born. This is one riddle, kong'an, we say kong'an&hellip; What is your real face, what is your real thing&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Real face</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S, P:</strong> Real face&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>before you were born&hellip;.<strong> *translates for Tathagata*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>That's very easy question. Everything reborn (revives) from what is in 'Motae'.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Motae</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Motae means the origin.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> The origin?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yeah, origin.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Everything is reborn through the origin (what are in their origin). If somebody is a human being, then they just understand they're human beings in past. And I reborn because</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>I means general people</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>reborn from the past (and they departed from the past and reborn). But, it is not easy for anyone to perceive their past life because they departed from the past life. But it is very easy for people to know who they were from the present self (present selves). Because everything that happened that existed in them appeared again and again (again and again from their behaviors). They should see their past from their present behavior.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well in&hellip; I&hellip; yeah, cause this is an often debated question about past lives and rebirth and reincarnation, but I am not really interested in that question, I'm interested in how I can be the best possible person right now in this time. My past lives, if there were past lives, that's already taken care of, I don't have to do anything about that. I do have to do something about this life.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>This life&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>It might be the most important thing for you is that to make you be Enlightened and make good you in the future. (This is the most important thing for you in the present)</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well it's the classic purpose in Buddhism&hellip; to try to be Enlightened, to try to liberate your mind from your conditioning&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Only Buddha could guide people's living, so when we speak good teaching we shouldn't teach in just a similar way (We shouldn't speak in similar way). When we speak something we should point out the very clear problem and after that we should tell the result of that. When we see things in this point, the people who contact the existing Buddhism practice very dangerous things. The other religions always make God stand. That's why when the intelligent people see other religions, there's not so much teachings in them. But Buddha's teachings are different than that. Because Buddha suggested the principle how this world is run. That's why if people contact the Buddhism in wrong way they are easily deceived by that. I met so many people in Thailand this time and I found many things that I was very surprised about. I will not meet the monks (Buddhist monks) and Buddhist scholars again. I found that the Buddhist monks and Buddhist scholars do many very dangerous things. You may met many of monks, that's why if I speak you, then you will understand what is the modern Buddhist (Buddhism) teachings (what do they teach). Thailand Buddhism speaks about meditation as the first step and the second is Buddhist scriptures. Third is precepts.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Is it all right?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Yeah, well yeah, the basic teachings, the Four Noble Truths and the Precepts, those are&ndash; that's where you start.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes&hellip; meditation, scriptures, precepts&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Please remember, I'll tell you why what they do is dangerous. If people sit down and they make their consciousness sleep, then the healthy people will lose themselves very quickly, and weak people will admit (to receive) the dead spirits. If people follow their guidance,</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>\\\"Their\\\" means Thai Buddhist monks</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>then this is like they kill their own soul. Then, why people regard that meditation is so important for them is because this is easiest way the dead spirits can enter to people's body. And the dead spirits always use the religion. The spirit that enter to human's body through the meditation (practice of meditation) they also use religion and they conquer people's body and consciousness. The problem is that when they are conquered by others' spirits they don't live by themselves but they act what the ghost want. In this case, they can't be reborn as human beings. When they die, they feel the great attachment to living and they try again to enter the human's body. The spirits who work (acted) in human's body, they find it impossible to reborn as human beings.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> The&hellip; uh&hellip; yeah, I don't&hellip;. The word spirits, it's not in my vocabulary in the sense of that, but it would seem the basic Buddhist teaching teaches meditation because the opposite, that the way the spirits come in is through your attachments and the way you get beyond that is by doing meditation and spirits have no ground to stand on. So I think what's being and what I would tend to believe is that it's my attachment, it's my conditioning, that allows, if you want to use the word, spirits to come in and be negative and do all&hellip; you know, anger, whatever. And that's in meditation that you actually relieve yourself of the spirits and they don't have a place to attach. So I think, actually, what I understand is the opposite.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Mm..</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>The evils always speak &ndash; it sounds very nice. Because I knew you visit me today, in the morning, I put you in (in me). You are good person but &ndash;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Do you understand, he says that \\\"put you in\\\"&hellip;.&nbsp; \\\"(in him)\\\"&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well I understand the words&hellip; I'm not sure how you do that.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Like a computer, you know? We put in you and he found that you are a good person. It means that you have a good basis. <strong>*continues to interpret for Tathagata* </strong>But because you contacted the meditation and scriptures (books), but that's why you are in level of danger now.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>I didn't meet you in the morning but I could read you (see you). Then if you wonder about this, you can test me.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (translating for Tathagata):</strong> I met you (Soyun has met you) and I (Soyun) told the Master Tathagata about you. So, Master's consciousness is like an electric wave. So, through me (through Soyun) He could see you.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Yeah&hellip; a lot of communication happens that way. I do have questions in the sense that meditation is dangerous and Buddhist precepts and Four Noble Truths and so on, if they're dangerous, what is the alternative to ask people to do if they want to purify or see through their conditioning and be liberated &ndash; what is the alternative? I mean cause Buddhism says meditation is one of the basic practices that you should do. So you need alternatives if you say no meditation. What do you tell people to do?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>For people's living, the proper exercise and working is the best. That's the best teaching for human's health: proper working and proper exercise.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Yeah well if when you say proper, one of the key words in Buddhism is \\\"mindful\\\", and I would&hellip; I like the Eightfold Path, you know, right action, and so on. What is proper? What is the whole understanding of work &ndash; of the work you're doing, the work I was doing today? Uh&hellip; so that calls for mindfulness and I would agree that everyday life is your best practice. I mean you practice with your life &ndash; your whole life.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>We need a standard to measure what is right and proper. For example, if we go to optician, then they have a picture</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> A chart</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>to measure our eye function. Like this, we put the standard to judge what is right and wrong.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> You put the what?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Measure&hellip; ah&hellip; standard. To judge what is wrong, what is right. Standard is 'what is'&hellip; 'what is'.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Even though the same object, but we can see in different way according their eyesights. In order to practice to carry out properly Eightfold Path, then the first thing we need to do is to awake ourselves. All the answers is decided by question (by problems). We need to learn first what kind of result expected by what matter. But when I see the Eightfold Path in the modern Buddhism, in scriptures, then I can't find the way in that teaching. In any teachings, the ways exist in the problems. We need to know first of all why people can't practice Eight path, because what they couldn't aware of to practice them, and Buddhist monks always speak this Four Noble Truths and Eightfold Path first (They always speak this first.) because they have only one aim to use this. This is to deceive others. When they speak this, people don't realize that they are deceived. Even though they are deceived they don't realize that. When I observe their teachings</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>He means that modern Buddhist monks' teachings</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>then it is more dreadful than the robbers and swindlers.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well the Eightfold Path is basically meaningless unless you apply it real situations in your life. I mean, you can say, I mean, I've been part of those teachings and have contributed sometimes or listened other times, and they're always very abstract until you say, right action, well then you take an action, a karmic action, and you bring it together with that principle, then you can see some truth. Alone, which I agree: too many monks and too many teachers just keep saying \\\"Eightfold Path, Eightfold Path, Eightfold Path&hellip;\\\" but it&hellip; it's meaningless&hellip; until you apply it to your life, to life direct&ndash; directly to life.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>So that's like Master said, to practice them, we need to awake</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Yea</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>We need to be aware of 'what is' first</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>And secondly, I would like to tell about the scriptures (Buddhist scriptures) &ndash; why are Buddhist scriptures bad. Any food will protect our body when you eat them when it's fresh. But no matter how nourish food, when they go bad, if you eat them, then it will harm our health.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well, that's very interesting because&hellip; it's a very interesting analogy&hellip; because I totally agree that if you just take things that are written down and communicate them in a dead way, or just as memory, that's poison, I agree, that you need to receive the teachings fresh.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> And you do that through your life,</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yeah</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> through your experiences. And that's why Buddhism to me is not a religion where it goes away from life, it's actually a religion that takes you right in the middle of your life in a very direct way, and mindful way.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>And the teachings made truth are the same like this. The deteriorated truth is like the poison (is like the bad food). In sutra, they didn't write <em>exactly</em> what Buddha taught (what Buddha said). Instead, they rewrite (rewrote) through their what they wanted.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> The sense that um&hellip; Buddha himself said to his followers \\\"Don't take my &ndash; don't take the writings, don't take other monks word, you have to experience it directly, you have to experience it through your own life, your own mind. \\\" And I&hellip; that is a wonderful statement by a spiritual leader that don't &hellip; and I think he was warning precisely about this problem &ndash; cause it's not fresh anymore. After 2,500 years it's not fresh. That you have to somehow go after the freshness of the message, and that can only be done through your own mind, your own experience, your own life.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>If people receive everything in the scriptures, this is just like they eat the deteriorated food. If people are once poisoned, then they refuse, they can't receive the restorative (tonic). In fact, it is almost impossible to transfer the right Buddha's teaching in Thailand. That's why I just sit in hotel room. I decided that I will not meet again the Buddhist monks or professors in Thailand. Most of Thai people and the intelligent people support the monks. After I saw all the reality, I realized that I shouldn't come here (I regret). And today, I meet you, so I would like to ask you&hellip; I'll remove everything dead in you, because you received them because you didn't know, but you received, they stay in you. And I can help you fresh and good soul revive in you. What do you think? Make yourself realize and show good self (good yourself)?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> I think eventually it's each person's responsibility to seek that freshness and that's what the search for Enlightenment is about, it's about seeking that freshness of experience, openness of experience, connected to the universe &ndash; the whole connection. But that has to be done by each individual, it really can't be done, I don't think, by somebody outside the individual. They can help, they can share, they can suggest, they can guide, but eventually it comes back to the person themselves having to do the work of Enlightenment.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>That's right. But when we know the right way, it's very easy for us to make ourselves realize and attain Enlightenment. You are considerably intelligent person, but with your current theory and knowledge, it's very difficult for you to work in this stage of the world. But in case you stay with me and you observe me what I do and you listen to me, then within two years you can be the best debater in this world. In order to be the best debater in this world, whatever you speak must keep the right side.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: \\\"</strong>Just\\\", you know? Justice.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>You should tell anything just to the principle of the world. If you spend one year with me, then what you think that you know (you know something, your existing knowledge) will be disappeared, and after two years you start to see the world, and whatever you talk has the reason and justice so it will agree with the world.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> I don't want to be the best debater in the world&hellip;. I &ndash; once you set up a goal like that, it shapes things, your expectations shape things, I just want to &ndash; I address the problem or the situation in front of me, and if that calls for me to debate, I do the best I can. But the idea of setting up a goal as the best or this&hellip; you know, it's like setting up a goal for Enlightenment. I don't set up that goal for Enlightenment. I try to live Enlightened ways every moment and sometimes I succeed, sometimes I fail, but I think once you set up goals like that or measurements I think it takes you off the path. You know, and, I've already learned several things from this conversation that have been very valuable so I really appreciate those things I learned, but I learn things from the whole universe. The whole universe is my teacher. And so I appreciate the teachings being offered and I have learned already some things that are very valuable that I can use and incorporate. But, I&hellip; I&hellip; I&hellip; I use everybody, every teacher that comes into my life, I try to learn from that person or that thing or, a bird, or a tree, or whatever.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>I agree with you.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> What?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>\\\"I agree with you.\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>I didn't completely finished even primary school. That's why until 17 years old, I didn't understand well that the word that society communicates. This is very funny episode&hellip; In one test, they said that you write down the&ndash;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Um&hellip; what is the&hellip; ant-&hellip; not similar&hellip; what's that? What is the word? If it's happiness, the unhappiness. What is the connection? I forgot the&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Opposite. Antonym? The opposite how you call it in English</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Paradox?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Not paradox&hellip; happiness, unhappiness&hellip; long, and short.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well, they're opposites&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Opposites or antagonists.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> But they're useful in Buddhism. Buddhism uses paradox all the time</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Opposites</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Opposites, to gain the truth&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>So it means that he even didn't know the very basic, basic way of communicate in society.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> I do want to mention, I read the book very carefully.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> And his story is very touching&hellip; touching of the heart. The struggle, you know, that's a very beautiful story and I just want to mention it.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>But that time was much easier than this time.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*all begin to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> A bigger goal&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T (laughing): </strong>At that time, I had to solve only my own mouth. But now, I have two more, and in London, maybe five. I have to support them also. But I can't work to make money because it is more urgent thing to awake human beings.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>I have to prepare all the expenses for this and I have to awake people but nobody receive me. Whenever I try to awake people, but they expelled me. I had hardship when I was young, when I was very, very hungry, I had to fill my stomach with water. But now I find it more difficult to stand the people's cold reception and everybody turn away from me. In spite of people's such attitude, I never forget this world even one day. This is my best teaching to remain for human beings. So I'm trying every day in order to find out one person among one million.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (interpreting for Master Tathagata):</strong> Hehe&hellip; So, Master asks you, How much salary do you have? If you don't mind&hellip; per month&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> A modest salary&hellip; Thirty-five thousand baht.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Thirty-five&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Thousand baht.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Thousand baht.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Baht.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> About 850, maybe, dollars&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes, 850&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Just enough to live on.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>That's too small salary&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>That's too small salary compared to your work. How much can you save except your residence and food&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well, I receive social security from the States &ndash; The United States &ndash; my government pension, which is around 40 thousand. So I try to save that for emergencies, or medical, or&hellip; if I got very sick I would have to go back to the United States where I have the medical &ndash; senior medical plan. So, I mean I can take care of small things here but if I really got sick, or seriously, I would have to go back to the United States.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>How old are you?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> 68.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (after translating):</strong> You look very young&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> You look young.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*laughing*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> It's interesting&hellip; Age is interesting, because I know lots of people who don't want to tell their age or they make it younger, but your age is very much part of your karmic path. That's where I am. I mean, my job is not to be 55, or 34, my job is to be a very good 68.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Satto begins laughing*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> The best I can be &ndash; 68. And next year I get to be the best I can be 69. So, I don't regret, or I don't try to say I'm younger or whatever. I am very honest about my age because I think once you start fudging that, or not being clear about that, you lose your karmic path, you lose your path. It becomes very delusionary. So I'm very pleased to be 68.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Soyun laughs and then translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Haven't you think about this &ndash; you spend the rest of your life for very worthy thing?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> That's my life. That's my commitment&hellip;. I'm not interested in making a lot of money, or&hellip; I'm just interested in contributing. That's my intention, basically from a Buddhist perspective. And if I can help the world in some way, that's my goal. So, that's why I'm here away from my family&hellip; my family, my two children, my two grandchildren, are in New Jersey. I see them once a year, and my sons don't understand why I'm here&hellip; \\\"Why not come back? Be grandfather?\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Be grandfather&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (translating for Tathagata):</strong> Master says,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>I look very poor, not so great, my appearance, but I can perceive everything in all the fields: economy, politics, medicine, science, philosophy. I have ability to understand all the fields in the world. If I can use a little of my ability, then I can prepare everything for doing this work (this mission). So I would like to suggest you one thing, so please tell me very frankly. I can provide the good shelter and foods and pocket money to you. How about you? Would you be my advisor to do this work for the world, for good thing? If you can admit (agree) with my suggestion, I'll compensate everything for that.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> I don't&hellip; I don't need compensation. I mean I have my life sort of worked out enough that I can support myself, but my job is to help people spread Buddhist words, so I'm available to help anybody, I mean, that's my job to do that. So, but I don't need anybody supporting me or when I get sick and die I guess I will go back to my children, or I'll die here, or die in Thailand. It doesn't matter.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (laughing):</strong> It doesn't matter&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>But what you do now is not right. We should see the result by the problems. We can't see the result from our thinking.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well my thinking is part &ndash; the problems and my thinking merge and I try to do the best I can, and that's my job. And, I disagree, I am doing what I need to do. This has been &ndash; this position has been given to me by the universe to do what I can, and I will do &ndash; I will continue to do what I can within the _________ University. That's my job right now, and I will move ahead with that and do the best I can. My intent is to help Buddhist principles be understood and used in the world, and the university gives me that opportunity.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>To awake, to call your attention, I mentioned about the food (fresh food and bad food). The modern Buddhism gives people poison. So, if you really want to work in that job continuously, then you should bet your soul. Everybody needs a great courage to listen to me and approach to me. That's why I suggested that I will compensate for you if you admit my suggestions, and listen how do I compensate for you (what is the content). Your soul is poisoned by much of something wrong. Because of that, in your</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>This part</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>chest, you have much of bad energy.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well, I don't believe in a soul, that's a word, so that can be defined in many ways. So, we're dealing with communication here, so soul may just be a communication problem. But I don't use the word soul, I have an impermanent, conditioned self, and I agree that like every other impermanent, conditioned self, it has fallacies, it has ignorance, it has delusion. And I work to clarify that. But, as I work to clarify that, I also do the best I can with what I know to share with people, and that's my job.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>According to my observation in the morning (I observed you), during our conversation, you should show something strange symptom but you are still very normal. You are already controlled by some power but you don't express that. Now I am confused who I talk to.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> I am controlled by the power of the universe, I really believe that, and the more I see through my conditioning, the more I see through my illusion or ignorance, then the more I am controlled by that force in the universe. And, that's why I don't see where, that's why I said when we first sat down that I don't see where I chose this job. This job &ndash; this situation &ndash; chose me, that I'm here, I'm working here because the universe is choosing me to do this work.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>If you can admit my suggestion and if you can become my advisor for this mission, then I'll let the force that controls you to achieve his or her wish. If I don't help him or her to achieve their wish, then they will not let you be free. The choice looks very simple, but this world is not going just by our minds. If you can come near me, you will be the advisor of a Messiah of this age. Instead, if you make just what you do now and you keep your working right now, then you will be the servant of the devil.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Whatever.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Whatever&hellip; Hehe.<strong> *translates for Tathagata*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> I, you know&hellip; You're making this thing as an attachment. I am happy to not succeed, to succeed, to succeed highly, to be totally frustrated. All those are acceptable to me. I don't put attachment into &ndash; I want it to be this way, I want to be that way, that's not good Buddhism. Buddhism teaches you to accept what is, what is happening, and I'm willing to accept what happens. I think that probably comes from more age &ndash; at 68, I, you know, I could die tomorrow. Anybody could die tomorrow. But it's very important not to get into this attachment realm &ndash; that you'll give me this, and I will give you that &ndash; I &ndash; no, I am an advisor. If you wanted me to be an advisor I can be an advisor, but within my role at the university. That's what I do. I advise. I share. I learn. I've learned today. So, it's very good. I can use some of the insight for other people. So that's my job, so I'm certainly willing to be an advisor but I don't want support, I don't want the attachment. You're not my teacher. You are my teacher. You're my teacher, and you're my teacher. And the world is my teacher. So.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>If we make good fruit (good result) from what we do, this is good. But what we do is collected to bad result then this is bad thing. Then, the Thailand Buddhism could prosperous like this without falsehood? So I am very anxious because the person like you live with hypocrites and live in falsehood, and the end of the world is decided. I can state very clearly at the risk of my life. Whoever engaged to religion deeply &ndash; any religions deeply &ndash; cannot be saved. I guarantee my statement with my life.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Yeah. The job of people who engage in spiritual path and teach as best they can is to live with hypocrites, is to live in the lion's den &ndash; Daniel in the Lion's Den &ndash; classic Christian story, where we need to live among hypocrites. That's where our job is. That's where our work is. It's not among the Enlightened people. If Avalokitesvara, he could have gone to Enlightenment, and he said, \\\"No, I need to stay to work with people till everybody's Enlightened.\\\" So I believe in the Bodhisattva ideal, I believe in that challenge, and my job is to live with people who lie and cheat and do things wrong and destroy their lives. That's my job, and I don't try to avoid that. I don't try to live other than live with people as they are and try to improve, to improve, try to encourage them to use Buddhist teachings, other religious teachings, universal, spiritual teachings in their lives. Cause we need that type of world. We need the world where people are using universal spiritual princi&ndash; teachings&hellip; freshly &ndash; in a fresh way.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>I speak very clearly here: Buddhism has nothing to do with all the Buddhas. I was in the center of Buddhas before I came to the world. But when I came to this world and when I tried to awake Buddhists, there's no one who treated even one glass of water to me. Unless you realize that you don't see the world correctly (you don't realize the world) then your knowledge will drive you to the edge of danger. I came into the world to save this, but I haven't done anything, I haven't achieved anything, just only make me in painful and suffering situations. You don't need to speak about the Bodhisattvas. The most important thing is that what has happened really. The Bodhidharma, who was the 28th&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Went to China&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes, went to China&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>and at that time, the Buddhism in India was become disappeared, but in China, the Buddhism prosperous. But Dharma was one person who received right teaching at that time, and when he came to China, the emperor received him. But the emperor saw a very poor monk came, but he was the 28th dharma, so he respect (emperor respect) the monk and he gave a question to him. Emperor said, \\\"I build several tens of thousands temples and I support numerous monks and I published so many Buddha scriptures, then how about my virtue?\\\" Then Dharma said only one word, \\\"Nothing.\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*some begin to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> That's good Buddhism.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>So, no matter how you may try to spread Buddhism, then your virtue is nothing.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> But that's okay. That's okay. There's a very famous story which I like very much, of a monk &ndash; the local rich person, or the emperor, gives the money to build a temple, gives him gold, and the monk goes ahead and builds the temple, but the emperor doesn't hear, or the head person doesn't hear, and he goes to the monk and says, you know, \\\"I gave you money, you built the temple, and I don't get any gratitude. Where's my gratitude?\\\" And the monk turned to him and said, \\\"The giver should be grateful.\\\" So&hellip; when you give, that's all you need to do. You just need to give. You just need to do your best and share and give and teach. That is enough. It doesn't matter what the result is. Hopefully, the result will be good, good karma, and will help people. But it doesn't&ndash; you don't &ndash; you can't be attached to the result. You just have to be attached to your process of Enlightenment.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Soyun laughs quietly*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> The rest takes care of itself.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes&hellip; that's what the monks interpret. That's not&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> No, that's what I interpret.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>You interpret&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> That is my interpretation.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>But most of the monks&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> I put it through my mind and my experience.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yeah&hellip; monks in general interpret like this about this story. They always use this story very, very badly. So just listen to him&hellip; he didn't say about the&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> He didn't finish</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>The meaning</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> The meaning, yes, of this story.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>That's your misunderstanding. The truthful person always say things very exactly.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Right or wrong, or even, this is 1, 1 is 1, 2 is 2. So very clear, everything is very clear.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Today, I met you, and we spent time to talk, and I really wanted to laugh about the world.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*as Tathagata speaks, Soyun begins to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>So he speak the reason he wants to laugh very loudly</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Because, in this world, there's no monks who is better than you. Then, from whom you can learn Buddhism? It's better for you to teach Buddhism by yourself. You can teach others then it will be virtue of you.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well, that's&hellip; that's&hellip; thank you. I'll think about that&hellip;. I have to go. It's been a very long day for me. I've been up since 5:30.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Oh! haha&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> I've been thinking very hard all day</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes, thinking very hard all day&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> and my mind now is &ndash; it's&hellip;&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> It's mush.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T (in English, as Soyun translates):</strong> Okay, okay, okay&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> I need to go have a beer.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Beer&hellip;!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Let my mind float&hellip; but please express my appreciation. I've, actually it's been very informative and I learned a lot, and I'm always happy to be &ndash; have my ideas tested and suggestions and so on, so, I'm very open to that, and I want to thank you very much.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Everything in this world is determined, that's why no one can break the appointment. That's why I also lead my living very lonely. I hope you will have good fortune.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Thank you.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Through all my life, I can say that I never cheated others, I never steal, I never harm others, and everything that I do has reason (right reason). When new world come, my activities will brighten this world for 1,000 years.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well we should all wish each other good luck&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>It was very nice to see you today.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Thank you.

What can I help you with?</p> <p><span style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Tathagata: </strong>I see many people go to church and I become to think there may be good in church. Is this the biggest Catholic church in Bangkok?</span></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Yes.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T (in English): </strong>Number one?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Soyun (interpreter for Tathagata): </strong>Yeah</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Today we meet first time so do you mind if I ask something that I'm wondering? May I ask you your age?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> I'm 70.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> When did you become a nun?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> 50 years ago.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> So, did you become a nun, not married?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> No.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Coffee and water arrive, with cookies*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Did you have any special motivation to become a nun at that time?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> I was attracted by this when I was very young.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> You lived in the church for 50 years, then probably you learned lots of things during this life.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Is that right?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> In this world, there are numerous people who rely on the church. They rely on church very much. What is the reason of their faith: because church has teaching, or God?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Church has teaching&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mm, or God? What is the reason of their faith?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C: </strong>I think that church will have to have faith in God, belief in God, you see? So it's the duty of the church to spread the good &ndash; we call it good news &ndash; about God.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> When you say God, then, the range of the object of the word is extremely big. When you say God, what do you mean? Do you mean, Holy Spirit or any other object?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> For us Catholic, we believe that God is the author of life. He has power to rule the Earth, he created the world, created all human beings and rules everything what exists in the world. And that's God, above any gods that people believe, that's the God, maybe, even Buddhism, they are praying for their Buddha, as kind of a, what do you call this, the preacher, a good man, what, for us, yes, Buddha is a good man, but there is someone above that who made, created, everything. That's God for us. We belong to God, we exist because of the power of God to protect us.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Is there any relationship between the churches and the creator, or Church borrows the name of God to manage and run their organization?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> What you call this relationship, the church, surely we have relationship with the creator, who is, we are creatures being created by God. So sure we belong to God. So the church is the members of those Catholics we have together in every part of the world, that we call the church, who kind of, are the followers of Christ, who believe in God the creator.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> What you explained just before, is it based on a kind of evidence (proof), or it came from the ideas of human beings?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> The belief of Catholics, the belief of faith&hellip; we believe that there is God and we adore that God who with us creates everything. And God is supreme in our life, we do anything, we try to obey the law given by God, by the church, to live a good life.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> You mentioned about the law that is given by the creator. Then what do you mean by the law?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> The law means the rule of life to live a good life. Now I want to say, there's no evidence like in science to prove this, prove that, but we have faith in God. God is teaching, we have the Holy Bible, with the teaching of Christ. And that is our law of life.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I have become more interested in talking to you. Can I confirm the teaching of Jesus in the Bible?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Yes.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Then could you teach me only one or could you share one teaching in Bible?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Instantly, now?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes. Only one. Not many.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Teaching of Christ is the son of God, as we believe in Christmas, God became man, and we call he's the son of God, came on Earth to live as man. He is not anything extra, being a child, born in a stable, and then he grow up. His job is go around teaching people to do good, and also there is no difference from him the poor, the rich, or all those who suffered, the sick. He's especially the friend of the poor and the sick, because the plan of God is to save all mankind, no matter he's sick or poor, he's a sinner or a good man, he wants everyone to be saved. And that's what we read about in the Bible, that God, the son of God, came down on Earth, to help, to save people, to lead a good life.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> So you introduce that one for us in Bible, the teaching of Jesus.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Yes.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> What you've told before, the church made this story for 2,000 years, or did you tell us the proof of the real life of Jesus?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> We mean the Gospel. The Gospel had been written, just now, all the history written, what happened 2,000 years ago, even before that we have the Old Testament, and the New Testament, all Testaments are both experiences by the people living during the time of Jesus or before Jesus was born. It's all recorded.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> But the history was written by human beings who worked for the church.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> All those who witnessed what's happening, you know?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Witnessed</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Then, I'd like to ask you your opinion. I heard from you Christ was more kind to the sick and the poor people. Mother Theresa who lived in India, actually is recorded as a nun who devoted her life for the sick and the poor. When we see record, Christ and Mother Theresa have done the same thing. But, Mother Theresa had honor and respect and adored so much by people when she was alive. But, about Jesus Christ, we cannot find any record he was adored and respected and had fame when he was alive at the time. Is there any difference between what Christ had done and Mother Theresa?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> It is easy now, that Mother Theresa believed in the teaching of Christ. She gave up her life even with her sisters too to help the poor. That's the example of Christ when he was alive.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Then, the teaching of Christ is very dangerous, isn't it? I'm talking about the aspect of soul.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Dangerous?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Dangerous</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I heard about the fame of Mother Theresa, so I went to India. When I visited Calcutta, she was not there at the time. But I had seen several tens of orphans and disabled children. Of course, several tens of orphans and disabled children were supported by Mother Theresa's activities. But, she collected huge donation from every part of the world because of those children. But she spent only less than 1% of donation for the poor. But we can't confirm the rest of 99% donation is used for what. It doesn't seem that Jesus Christ taught such dangerous thing. So, we really want to know what is true teaching of Jesus. I can see your soul is much more higher than the soul of Mother Theresa. Mother Theresa cannot be reborn (revive) as a human being. Do you believe that the Bible has the real teaching of Christ? Jesus sacrificed his own life for humankind. So, his teaching should be revealed in this world. If the churches hide good teaching, instead, they make God stand. This is sin.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> They make God&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Stand. They always represent only God, not teaching.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Even tarot can do make god stand.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*The door buzzes, and then someone enters the room*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Entrant: </strong>Good morning!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Good morning!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*A brief side conversation takes place*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I've lived over 60 years now and during my life, I had a big question about the church. Many people are Christian, they go to church, but all of them always call the name God. They always make God stand, and many of them are always pray (chanting, singing) for receiving Holy Spirit. Then could you tell me, what is God and what is the Holy Spirit?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C: </strong>Now for us, there are three persons in God. God the father, his work, he's the creator, create the world, God the father. And God the son who came down to be a child. And God the Holy Spirit, he's the spirit of God, who animates, who uplifts us all, who gives a blessing to people, especially encouragement in time of difficulties, that's the Holy Spirit's job. We have different parts of our body that Christ (God) has got something like that.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> The creator you say is worried about human world, but it never contact humankind, and God never give birth child. Then what is the evidence that Jesus is the son of the creator? Third, I want to know about the Holy Spirit. Can I understand as the soul of the dead is the Holy Spirit?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> The soul of the dead&hellip; the Holy Spirit?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yea</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> The dead person&hellip; like you and me, we have two lives, the body is a life, but you have another life, that's the spirit within you. When a person dies, his body, the spirit is out of his body, that's why he's dead. Personally now, I am just feeling that your questions are going deeper and deeper, but if you are interested to learn religion, there must be a long course. It's not by questions like that.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>You've already passed that long course. So it will not be so difficult a job for you to help us understand.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C: </strong>No, no&hellip; I mean that there must be following study. It's not just a conversation like that&hellip; you have to see the Bible, this is our text to study.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Teaching always in the questions.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Yes, if the questions are based on something&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> People can't learn anything if the question cannot be revealed. You've already known one thing. You said we have two lives: body and soul. Then, is it right if I regard the body as a kind of instrument (tool)? And is it right if I understand that the soul is like a car driver that controls the car, like the soul is growing up by using the activities of body? So soul is like driver and body is like car?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Is it correct, can you understand like this, soul and body?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> No, sometimes the body is directing the soul.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Body is?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Is kind of a driver.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Body is kind of a driver?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Because a soul, soul is inactive, it's within you, the soul cannot tell you, this is right, that is wrong. But if the body wants to do the own way, it's against the feeling within you, it will.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> According to my common sense, I haven't found this case that the body is the driver for soul. When somebody receives Holy Spirit, then they have two drivers in one body, and if they receive more Holy Spirits, it means they have more drivers.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> There is only one spirit. There is one spirit coming from God. That is ideas maybe, you know? Within you, you learn a lot, so you believe in this and that, you kind of directed your life. But the spirit of God, there is a new one, there is no divisions, no divisions&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If somebody speaks something that they haven't seen, it's a lie. Or, if somebody saw something then they must explain what they saw in order that the other people can understand. So if they don't have very clear evidence in what they speak, it means that they haven't seen exactly. I don't say it is bad that some people receive Holy Spirit, but I have been wondering how people give up their soul and receive others' soul? This is my first case.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> How is it possible for human beings?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> That's influence.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> That's influence&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> The influence of all around us, you know? Especially at present times, there are so many bad influences, and look at the young generations, they will not do what the parents teach them, tell them to do. But the _______ [Note: couldn't make out this word], the trends, all what's happened around them, that is man's spirit coming into realignment.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> When I see the life of Christ, I cannot believe that Jesus taught you should receive Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Jesus taught&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> May I repeat&hellip; He said, When he observes the life of Jesus Christ, he doesn't believe that Christ told people you should receive Holy Spirit.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Person really seek Holy Spirit or not, it's not because Christ told, but person personally, you have faith in God, and Christ is teaching all what God wants us to know. But then it's like you, you want to believe or not, you want to receive Holy Spirit or not, it's up to each one of us. It's not Christ force you to receive the Holy Spirit. It's faith that we need to do.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If people followed the modern church's instruction, then more and more people will receive Holy Spirit in the future. Jesus' work and Mother Theresa's work look similar, but when people see them, they had a different understanding from people. Jesus understood what true love was, and he practiced the true love. Mother Theresa had done the similar mission, but she only used the poor and the unhappy, miserable people, without understanding love. Because Jesus practiced love, that's why he didn't obtain anything except good mind. That's why nobody yearned (envied) Jesus. But people could see what Mother Theresa obtained by using the poor. She could get huge wealth (huge money). That's why so many people adored her (envied her). When I went to India for the first time, I asked to journalists, \\\"Who could you recommend for the meeting and talking in India?\\\" Most of them recommended me, \\\"Oh, you should meet Mother Theresa here.\\\" But, we found very interesting consequences. Jesus couldn't obtain anything but his soul could reach heaven. But Mother Theresa enjoyed fame and money. She didn't know any lacking in her late age. But she had to go the most dreadful path. If people don't realize 'what is', they are like the blind. I hope the teaching of Jesus Christ will brighten again in this world by your effort. At that time, we will be able to be real sisters and brothers. The Bible was written by the hand of human beings, and also was written by the people who has Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C: </strong>And also, the four Gospels, Matthew, Luke, Mark, John, they lived in the time of Christ. What is written there is because they witnessed what Christ did. So that we, this generation, should be able to know what was happening during that time.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I agree there are some records about the activities of Jesus Christ at that time and what he told to people. But, I'm sorry for this point in the Bible, but people who wrote about the activities of Jesus Christ and the teaching of him, had a very huge gap of level of consciousness between Jesus. That's why they couldn't understand really about him and they couldn't write down properly. Because the teaching of Jesus was not told rightly in the Bible, that's why if we see Jesus now, he looks like the king of the devil. We will be able to save mankind only when we revive the teaching of Jesus and his sacrifice. Could you teach me where can I find somebody who really wants to follow Jesus? (Please tell me where can I find someone who is a real follower of Jesus.)</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Someone?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Someone, yeah&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> There are priests in the rectory. A priest is supposed to be someone who is teaching, who is living the life of Christ. He's Christ's representative at this time. As an ordained priest, his job is to perform all the sacrifices and he teaches those who want to learn more about Christ, about Christian teaching.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Thank you very much for your kindness.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> You know we have two priests working in Korea, the priests from this organization working in Korea.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> How many priests do you have?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> About seven.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> About seven?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Seven. They go to different places, they are assigned to different work.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Okay. So when you say priest, you don't&hellip;&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> If you go to the rectory, you'll find someone.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, find someone. Not any&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto (secretary, sound engineer):</strong> Like specifically&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, specific man&hellip; no?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Who you think is better&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> They are all able to help you&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> It was helpful for us to understand the churches.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> You seem to know a lot about Christians&hellip; Catholics&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata chuckles*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Thank you so much.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (translating for Tathagata):</strong> He is a scientist.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Scientists sometimes&hellip; want proof, evidence&hellip; but religion is not to prove, to have real evidence. We accept the teaching we believe.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> We can understand the teaching only through the problems. But I am sorry that religious teaching doesn't have any questions (any problems). But I am very surprised that the people who has religion are mostly very brave and have the spirit of sacrifice. But, people, like us, cannot give my soul to Holy Spirit even though I have 10,000 times of birth.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C: </strong>10,000&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Times of birth.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Births. Even we are born 10,000 times&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Reborn.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Reborn. Recreation&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Recreation,</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S, Satto:</strong> Reincarnation&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Reincarnation&hellip; You are Buddhist?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Everything in the world exists by transmigration and they revive everything what happened in them by transmigration. This is the secret that makes this world exist. Of course, if you make people realize, then there's no way religion can survive. When people are awakened, this world will be changed as the world of humankind, not the world of spirits. I don't know anything but, for you, I'd like to tell you one thing. Jesus came down to Earth not for making this world of gods (spirits) but for humankind. (He wanted to make this world for human beings.) But the churches use the will of Jesus adversely (in the opposite way), and this is to kill Jesus again. We have to repent and joy by 'what is' in the present. I would like to be your friend. Is it possible?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> But you are one!&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*all laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> There are good people and bad people. But every society, some are very good, and trying to help one another. But, you mention about the church, the church is, all the Catholics, who have been baptized, who are Catholics, but of course Catholics that've been baptized, they're not a passport to go to heaven, or to be good always, they're human beings. So they're tempted by the devils. Sometimes they're good, sometimes they misbehave. That's human beings.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> How about you? Being a real person, you are 70 years old. I am 63. You are older than me, but it will make a problem if I like you?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*all laughing*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> You are a virgin, but I am married once.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> But we can be friends&hellip; There's no objection for that. We can be friends.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> We can be friends&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T (laughing):</strong> Spiritually, let's be close. When I come here again, I'll speak a little more English. I will study.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Are you staying here in Bangkok?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes at the moment.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> At the moment, all of you?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes, we are travelers&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Travelers&hellip; to different places&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah&hellip; we are a group.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> To study more about religion, is that right?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> That's right. We want to learn things in universities and religion. But so far, what we've learned from universities and religions is too low level.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> What university did you go to?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> We've been to lots of famous universities.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto: </strong>You mean in Bangkok, or anywhere&hellip;? Chulalongkorn, Assumption&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Low in which way?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Low?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> The content that they teach&hellip;. I could find some good people among the students but I couldn't find any desirable person among professors. There are more possibilities to ruin people if they have wrong education. I became an orphan when I was very young, so I had to stop my schooling in the primary school. When I visited universities I was very proud of myself because I haven't learned in schools. If some people ask me what philosophy is, then I can answer what philosophy is, but when I met many of professors in philosophy department, nobody could answer to my question what the philosophy is. I don't understand why every professors were very scared of me when they met me. I don't have any knife or guns&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Soyun and Tathagata laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> They always ran away from me. If I ask only one question, they always said, \\\"Oh I don't have time, I'm very busy&hellip;\\\" So I don't know what do they know. They are better than me in one point. They speak lie very fluently.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Speak&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Speak lie (falsehood)</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (translating for Tathagata):</strong> He really want you were a little bit younger&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Soyun laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T (speaking in English):</strong> Can you make me &hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> No.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T (in English):</strong> Okay&hellip; Can you make me happy?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*laughing*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> He's learning English.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> He practiced this one sentence for one week but now he wants to speak something to you.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> I think he have already&hellip; it's correct&hellip; now continue what you are saying&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (translating for Tathagata):</strong> He wanted to speak to you just before, \\\"Could you date with me now?\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Date&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Date, date, he wants a date.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Date. So, he doesn't need translators. He only wants date with you, so hold hand, and go out for dinner,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*all laughing*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Say in English</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> That's why now he decided that he will practice English and after that he will come here again to meet you.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Ah, he says, \\\"It's no problem, when a man date with a loving woman, then speaking not necessary.\\\" So he become happy if he only see each other.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I have one skill. I have a power if I really want to expand somebody's life, I can. I will stay in this planet 10 years more from now. If you die before me, I'll be lonely,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*all laugh and someone claps hands*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> So I will help you to live more 11 years.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (translating for Tathagata):</strong> Can you calculate, he will stay in this planet more 10 years, so he wants you stay also in this planet&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> So we meet next world&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Soyun laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If you want to become my lover or my friend in the next world, then I should bring you to heaven. But, you should find the way to heaven in yourself. I can open the way then, could you go the way (the way to heaven)?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> This is what I am doing now. I am on the way to heaven in my life.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Everything in the world is predestined, and these determined things can find the way in the problems. No matter how you may wish to go to heaven, it is impossible for you if you don't know the way. If you can give me one right answer to my 1,000 questions, then you are the person who can go to heaven. Nobody can go heaven through church. Jesus came to Earth to build the way but he failed. Then, where can you find the way? There is only one man who knows the way in living people. Look at my face. If I speak you truth or untruth. In the appearance of the saints who stayed in legend, we can find a saint who has a real third eye. Only such being can know the way to heaven. Now we became friends, so please look at my face. I have an eye on my forehead. This is the eye that can see the ways. This is not a bonk.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Can you see that? No?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> From the side</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Can you see what's in his forehead?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> He has here, like a&hellip; the outside.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If you can promise to be my friend then I can give you everything that you want. My duty in this age is to find out people who is like Jesus, and this civilization will disappear very soon.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> This civilization&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> This world, this current world&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Many prophets foretold this age will have the end of the world. I want to save the human world again. For 20 years, I have been trying for this and I visited universities and religions but nobody has interest in my mission (my activities). I can take off all my clothes to draw people's attention and I can sit down on the street with naked</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Soyun laughing*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Then, maybe many people will pay attention. But it will not go for a long time because police will come immediately and say, \\\"You break the law!\\\" That's why I'm very stuffy now (anxious). I'm looking for Jesus in this world but there's no way to meet. So please be Christ by yourself!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> I would invite you to go to our church and see, you sit with time to yourself, quietly a while, maybe you'll find Jesus there.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> No, spirits with falsehood never can approach to me.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> You just try and give yourself to the chapel - have you stopped at the church?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes we stopped. But he says, \\\"I want living Jesus. (I want living Christ.)\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Thank you for your time.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> How long will you be here, going out, visiting the country?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Actually, he has traveling about 50 countries around the world.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Going 'round the country here?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Here? We are going to Chiangmai tomorrow, stay there for about five days, and go to Kuala Lumpur, and following that we will go to Korea.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C: </strong>We have sisters working there in Kuala Lumpur too, in Malaysia&hellip;. And find Christ. Go and find Jesus Christ in Kuala Lumpur, in Chiangmai&hellip; there are nice people.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Yes, I continue to look for them, but I'm not sure if it's possible&hellip;. I cannot trust what people speak. For example, Mother Theresa. Her work was not right. She had excellent talent to induce people's donations, and there's nobody who had more success than her by using the poor people, very miserable people. In spite of her work what she has done, people call her as a saint. Then, whom can we believe and trust? We shouldn't believe something that is not verified. So remember this. You shouldn't keep everything under the Holy Spirit's custody. &hellip; If we could met when you were 26, and I was 21, then I would depend you, \\\"Please don't be nun, marry me!\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*all laughing*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> So we met too late. Maybe you looked very pretty when you were young&hellip; everybody praised you&hellip;. But don't worry, still I really want to travel with you.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Satto and Soyun laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> And we could have a meal together, and drink tea together&hellip; sleep together?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*all laughing and having a good time*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Have a long life. Let's meet again.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Thank you! Thank you&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Do you mind if I hold your hand once?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T (laughing):</strong> Is it safe? It is too direct?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> No&hellip; if it's just meeting friends like that, it's alright. It's nothing special, isn't it?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Yeah, I don't want special relationship&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*all laughing*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> No?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Okay, have a nice trip and new year. Bless you all.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> We were very pleased&hellip;.</p> <hr/> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Good morning!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Catholic priest:</strong> Hi! What can I do for you?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Hello.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> We came here to have some good news (teaching).&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> You want teaching, or you want a job to be a teacher, or what?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> No, no, we want to listen some teachings from the church.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Priest and Tathagata begin to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> You say, \\\"good news\\\"? What's that ?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> We've heard this is the biggest Catholic church in Bangkok. Is it true?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (interpreting priest):</strong> Yes.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> So we came here to meet some priests who can introduce about the Catholic teaching. Could you introduce some priests to save our soul.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Normally what I do is that I give you a booklet. You want to read about the Catholic faith, the church, preaching, or let you know about our Catholic faith. After that when you have some ideas then we're gonna come and explain to you what you want to know about this and other topics, what the teaching of the church concerning with certain subject. When you just come in and you want to know about Catholic faith it's so long and so big and it takes so much time, but if you have a booklet, you want to follow the teaching which one is for what, you know?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> We've read many books already. But, I couldn't find answer about life in any books. I saw so many people go church, and I have questions. What can I obtain if I go to church? I started my travel to find the answer of life. I wanted to know the right answer what is the way of life and how we should live. This morning, I asked to the staff in my hotel, \\\"Where is the biggest Catholic church in Bangkok?\\\" So they told us to come here.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Our church here is not the biggest one in Bangkok&hellip; our church here is catering to English speaking people. We have more schedules for masses in English than in Thai.&nbsp; The main church here in Bangkok is the Cathedral &ndash; the Assumption Cathedral. It's in Bang Rak area, it's where Oriental Hotel&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Oriental Hotel?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Yeah. That's the main church. So our mass schedule here is catering to English speaking people. Okay, if you want to come in the other room here so I can&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*movement occurs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> So mass is for Sunday. We have nine masses, two on Saturday afternoon, and seven on Sunday. And out of nine here we have four Thai masses for the native and we have five for English-speaking people. Especially on a big day like Christmas or Easter, we have a special mass schedule for all people. So&hellip; you know, here we are catering to the needs of the people. This church has many foreigners attending mass here. We have from different nations: Africa, from Asia, Europe, Eastern Europe, from America, &hellip;. And in the area here, we do not have parishioners because before it was a slum but now they developing into high rise and it's so expensive. No ordinary people stay in this area, so people that come to church here normally have to drive, take public transportation to come to our mass.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Personal teaching?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Question.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Yeah, please.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> When did you become a priest?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Oh, about 30 years ago.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> 30&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> And I'm 63 years old. I've been a pastor here for three years.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> You look so young!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> He's 63, but looks like a younger man!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> I'm an old man!&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I envy you!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*laughing*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> What is the duty of church? Is your duty to spread God to people or to spread teaching?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> We have different functions. In priesthood, some evangelize by media, radio, television, newspaper. For us, mainly, to taking care of the people who come to this church. So, not only who come to this church, we have to prepare them for the sacraments. We prepare them for baptism, marriage, and burial. So, not only preaching and have mass for them, but we have other sacraments we help with for people.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If you do such kind of things, then any other places also perform them, not even only church.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> See, as I said, we have at least ten churches in the Bangkok area here: St. Louis, Assumption, and many other churches, okay&hellip; but this one is very different because the person that came and set up this church here from America, loved the Thai culture and customs, so we built the church in Thai style &ndash; not the Buddhist style, but Thai style. And our church here has been built for 50 years.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Church has been built&hellip; for 50 years?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> 50 years.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Do you have any differences between the Catholic and other religions?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Yes we do. The Roman Catholic that we are preaching and preserving is special, but other Christian churches with different denominations, there is Anglican, Church of Christ, Baptist, Mormon, they originally believed in Christ, but the way they practice is very different from Catholic faith.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> As you said that what you work here, like wedding, funeral, or building schools, those things are the same as social thing (social work). So if you do just such things, is it really that church is necessary for people's life?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C: </strong>Because a lot of time we think in the Catholic faith we have seven sacraments, baptism, confirmation, holy communion, confession, anointing, marriage, and ordination to the priesthood. So what we do is that we take care of the people, not only they were born and be baptized, but then they are sick, we have to reach them &ndash; at home, hospital, we have to give them the sacraments preparing for the journey. We believe that our life here on Earth is very short, comparing. So we have to prepare them not only when they are healthy but when they are sick. If it is the will of God that they have to die then we prepare them to die.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I've known you teach about human life. Is it true&hellip; no?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> People's life. We're teaching about people's life, it's not about humans, a process, or steps&hellip;. Taking human life by means of abortion is wrong, taking life by euthanasia is wrong. So our teaching is God created us, we have body and soul. We are not like animals, you know, chickens, or ducks, or dogs, or other things. Our human soul is immortal. Yes? You know, when we die, our body and soul will be in heaven with God. So that's a thing we consider the dignity of the person. We are sacred, immortal in the eye of God. We were cremated&ndash; created, in the image of God. So we share the life of Christ. So this is meaning of the mass when we come and offer ourselves to God, and we receive the body and blood of Christ as part of our life.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> You say about the life of Jesus, then what sort of life did Jesus live?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Jesus Christ believed in Judaism, Jesus is a Jew. So he knows about the Old Testament, the holy scriptures in the past before him. In the Bible, we divide into two parts. One is called the Old Testament and the other one is the New Testament. Old Testament is about from creation until John the Baptist. The New Testament started with Jesus until the last of his apostles.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If Jesus believed in Judaism, but I know that Jesus was killed by Jews. Then, he was a traitor of Judaism?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> It's a long history of the Old Testament, but what I would like to explain very shortly is that when Adam and Eva, or Adam and Eve, according to the Bible, you know the Bible happened a long time ago, but in written language, we believe about 4,000 years ago, so we have tradition. We have the story, that moral teaching of what happened. So we believe that's God. God created the human being, whether real Adam and Eve, we don't care. We care it's that God created our human being.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> How can you prove that Creator created human beings?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> We call that science, you know, we know that the human person, the bones and structure, may be hundred thousand years ago. That's human being &ndash; people &ndash; living long time ago. But as I said, the Bible, we have characters, letters, put into common language we can communicate about 4,000 years ago. We have history, we have tradition, we have four fathers &ndash; the fathers, the son, and the grandson, so this is what we believe, there's a God, there's a God who created our human being. Okay. But when the four fathers commit sin, they want to be like God, you know. Sins, what you call it &ndash; original sin. But God promised to send a savior. So when Abraham was called to be the father of faith for the Jewish people, then the Jewish people, the chosen race, believed that the Messiah will be born one of these days to redeem mankind. So Jesus Christ knows about the promise in the past. He knew about the Ten Commandments. He knew about Moses, he knew about David, he knows everything in the Old Testament. But he's not happy with &ndash; there's a teaching with, you know, letter, law, and command. Jesus Christ was born as the Messiah but people did not expect him to be the Messiah. Because the Jews expect the Messiah to be great king, big army, power, money, to overthrow the Romans who occupied Palestine during that time. But Jesus came, he said, \\\"I'm really king. But king for the poor, the sick, the suffering, people who are looking for faith and the truth.\\\" So Jesus Christ changed the teaching, the meaning of the law, and the meaning of people's lives is love &ndash; forgiveness. And that's why when he was born, not so many people accepted him. Because he's different from what they expected as great king, royal family, big army, money, power.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Then, did Jesus do similar thing that recently Mother Theresa has done in India?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Mother Theresa did not do the thing she's supposed to do because of Jesus Christ, she did it because Jesus taught her how to do it &ndash; love the poor, take care of the dignity of the person. Mother Theresa, without Jesus Christ, she wouldn't do it. I remember one day, Mother Theresa washing the wounds of the sick, the dying, had no hope of recovery. The doctor said, \\\"What a waste of time, you are doing this&hellip; The person's gonna die anyway. If you give me a million rupees, I won't do it.\\\" Mother Theresa said, \\\"If it helps Christ, I'll do it. I do it because of Christ.\\\" That's why, you said that Jesus did the same thing as Mother Theresa, I have to switch around. Mother Theresa believed in Jesus Christ, that's why Mother Theresa did many good things. Without Jesus Christ, she wouldn't do it.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I am become confused when I listened to you. I don't understand this point. Christ had same thing, he took care of the poor, sick, and the unhappy people at the time, but he was not received by people at the time. But Mother Theresa practiced the same thing, but she had very great respect and was adored. Why is it so different in the result?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> The teaching of Christ is just from a small group. Maybe ten thousand, maybe a hundred thousand, but he picked only twelve people to represent him. And then before he died, before he went to heaven, he said go out and tell people the good news what I did. Tell them about my teaching, tell them about my life. So, from twelve people, they went out to different places and twelve picked other people to teach or preach. So mouth to mouth, okay? We had no television, no newspaper, no diary, no laptop, no computer. But people, it's 2,000 years ago, you know? But Mother Theresa, one of Jesus' disciples, she learned about Jesus Christ, about his work, that's why she started doing it. Mother Theresa had many objections. Many people thought that she get the money, she getting wealthy, not because for the poor, but for herself. In Thailand, we have four sisters from India working like Mother Theresa in Nong Bua Lamphu. I was the one that invited them and set up the place for them and now they're working for AIDS victims, for the orphans, for people that are dying. So they carry on this work. Not so many people recognize this. They say, where is Nong Bua Lamphu, where is the sisters? Yes, we have television, we have newspapers, but it's not well known yet. Mother Theresa, because she dared to speak against the wealthy nations, against the people who took advantage of the poor and sick, that's why she was famous. And people were watching her all the time, when she got donations, they say, \\\"Aha. She get rich.\\\" No. She send people to different places. Even in America, Sister Theresa sent nuns to work there. In Singapore, in Russia, in different places, even in Thailand.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>When I listen more and more to you, then I become more impressed. Jesus told his twelve disciples, go and teach</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Tell the good news</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Tell the good news,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> and transfer my teaching. Then what is the teaching of Jesus?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> There's one God that created everything. We call it the profession of faith. The prayer that we have the core of the teaching, we call it the charisma, what we have to believe: there's one God. God created everything. God created human beings, God sent his son Jesus Christ to redeem mankind. God sent the Holy Spirit to build up the church, to help the apostles, the disciples of Christ to spread the good news. Christ teach us that one day we gonna die, but if we persevere, if we believe in him and his teaching, our body die but our soul never die when we believe in the life after. That means God will welcome into his kingdom. He teach about the church, that carry on the mission of Christ. God will be with his church until the end of time. No one can destroy his church. The members of the church are people in heaven we call the saints, people who die who still have not purified we call people in purgatory, and we have the people that journey on this Earth still doing good, sometimes sins, but we are on the journey to the kingdom. So three members of Jesus Christ's church: people still alive we call the pilgrim's church, people who die but still in purgatory, in purification, we call the church suffering, and those that won the victory, that means they were purified, in heaven, we call the saints. So this is the teaching of Christ. They're talking about God, his role as the redeemer, how he has the holy spirit who give us power, give us light, give us special graces, and talking about the church. Jesus Christ is the head of the church, but he left that power to his apostles which he called the pope, the head of the church. And the church have to leave a light, we call it the pilgrim's church. So in the pilgrim's church we need praise, we need the sacraments, we need support so that they will persevere in their faith. They will keep the faith that Jesus Christ taught, and his disciples taught through the church.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Are you sure that what you explained to me about the teaching of Jesus is absolutely correct? We can contact very easily some people who always represent God (always make God stand) when they have spirits in them. But Saints always tried to teach people (to awake people) and when they teach something they always pointed out 'what is'. The difference between the Saints and the ordinary people is that they are not controlled (they are not influenced) by spirits, and the Saints never make god stand, and I believe that Jesus is a Saint. I can't believe that Jesus had the other spirit in him or Jesus made god stand, and god never give birth child. So it is impossible god has son (child). Then it means Jesus told untruth. I can't believe this fact.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> There are many thing about God is a mystery because we are human, he is divine. One of the professors, very smart and he wrote hundreds, hundreds of books, he would like to explain about God by simple language that people can understand. He had to believe but he would like to explain it to the people. So he was walking the sea shore, you know, water, and sand, he tried to think what language he's gonna explain about God, God the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit, three persons, why one? Why we call God? Why the three persons are equal? Why God this thing, and that. Why, why, why? So many questions. So he tried to think. He was walking on the sea shore and he saw a boy digging the hole in the sand, and used a shell and scooped the water and put it in the hole. So he walked back and forth, he saw that, finally he stopped and said, \\\"What are you doing?\\\" and the child said, \\\"I tried to get all the water in the ocean to fit in the hole.\\\" And this professor said, \\\"You're stupid, you're stupid, how can you do that?\\\" And the child stood up and said, \\\"You, a human person, you have a small brain. Why you think so much about God that you didn't know, why you try to narrow God down to your own thinking and your own language? It's easier for me to put the ocean water in the hole than for you to think about God in the written language.\\\" So many thing is a mystery. Jesus Christ never lied. Jesus Christ said my father and the holy spirit, he mentioned many times in the Bible, in the scriptures. He mentioned that the father and I and the holy spirit are working together. He would never lie, because he teach &ndash; if he lies, then his church no longer be right now. But he said, 'I will be in my church and this is the teaching that I entrusting to you, you have to spread the teaching.'</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If Jesus told like that, what you said, then I doubt he is in heaven or not, because I believe that he came to heaven. So, if your explanation is true, then I must check again and I have to evaluate again if he's dead on the cross. If he really told like that, it was impossible for him to go to heaven. So, if Bible has this teaching, these words, then it means it insults Jesus, and this is not something that somebody who has a sound spirit can speak. If I make just the gist of what are in the Bible, what Jesus told, then Jesus was not like that man. He was killed by people because he tried to practice the true love. From my point of view, because Jesus tried to reveal what was, at that time, in reality, that's why the spirits (gods) afraid of him. So, they killed Jesus by using the hand of living people. The difference between Jesus and Mother Theresa was that Jesus tried to practice true love, but Mother Theresa practiced a false (fake) love. If Mother Theresa could practice the real (true) love, then there's few people around her, and nobody really wanted to help. Twenty years ago, I heard the name of Mother Theresa, so I visited India, and I stopped in Calcutta. I asked to journalists there, \\\"Who do you have who you can recommend to me in India.\\\" Most of them recommended Mother Theresa. So I visited her house (church) and the orphan house was very poor, and there were several tens of orphans, several tens of disabled children, and some nuns (many nuns). She appealed to all the world using the orphans and disabled, \\\"Please help this orphan&hellip;.\\\" As the result, she could get huge donations every year, and that gave her fame and made her very famous, and she became the object of longing. But in fact, she spent less than 1% of all donations for the poor and sick in India. When we evaluate on the result, then the love she practiced was false. She practiced only fake love, and she could get fame and wealth, and she could ride on first class, and she could stay in a five-star hotel. It was for her desires. Not everyone can do what she did. For that, somebody needs the nature (they should be born like that). This is the real reason that she became very famous. If somebody really do something good, mass media doesn't deal with them. Where is the better things to reveal the world? When somebody reveals the world, people can protect themselves from deceiving and they can live on the right way. But at this moment, religion uses Jesus. When you say \\\"truth\\\", it means that there is a way in the problem. I haven't found any religion that has the way and truthful teaching. I am traveling to find out somebody who is like Jesus.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C: </strong>What language is he speaking?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Korean.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Korean. We have a Thai priest study Korean, working in Korea for about nine years. Now he is in America, he will be back here in January. He knows Korean real well. He should be back here by the middle of January. You can talk directly in Korean to him. We have one more priest, he also in Korea for about 6-7 years. He helping, preaching in Korean language, but he also help the Thai people that working in Korea that have difficulties like with employers, employees, and helping them. So, he's the same priest like me, but he's working in Korea. First of all, you ask me a question, I'm not trying to convert you, but I explain what I believe, what I, you know, my basic &ndash; my life. I can be a businessman, I can be a teacher, I can be famous in different areas, but I strongly believe in Jesus Christ, that's why I choose to be a priest. About Mother Theresa, many people say different things. Time proves itself, okay, so let the course of history prove that she's fake, phony, or she's real. I don't want to discuss about the life of Mother Theresa, but I knew her sister that's working in Nong Bua Lamphu, I know for life because how they visit the poor, the sick&hellip; they do not reveal who donates money at that time. But the money is from the people, for helping people in that area. So I know for a fact that they do not get a lot of money from America, from different places, they get the money from the people in the village. Okay, this one sick person stay at home, and people come and help. So the sisters come, dress up their wounds, give them medicine, and give direction what they gonna do. Okay, this I see for a fact. I didn't know Mother Theresa, but I know about her teaching. Every time she take care of the poor, she didn't see the sick, she saw Jesus Christ in those persons. When she received Holy Communion, she didn't see Jesus Christ, she see the face of the poor people that she's serving. So, I believe that. One last point that I want to make, that Jesus Christ is real for me because he suffered so much. Why did you kill him? Two things. They didn't expect him to be the leader. They thought that the leader had to be from a royal family, to be king, to be emperor, okay, so they disappointed. Second, his teaching is not the same old style like the Jews practiced before. He put life in people. You're not telling this, you don't do this, you don't do that, he said, \\\"Do it. Explain to the people why you did it.\\\" So, he practicing and tell the people of the reason. So his teaching is different from the past. And \\\"Listen, I am the son of God. I have the power to forgive the sin. I have the power to heal you. When you are crippled, you walk. When you are blind, you can see.\\\" And when he died, he said, \\\"In three days, I will prove to you I am truly God.\\\" When he rose up, he appeared to different people. You know, the door shut like this, he walked through, and he explained, \\\"I am, I'm here. If you persevere in my teaching, one day you will be like me.\\\" He had a mystical body, that you don't need space and time but you can do things. And then he said, \\\"I will go, I will prepare the place for you. So all of you will be with me one day.\\\" And many people said, \\\"Well, I ate with you, I listened to your talk, I do this, and you among us.\\\" Jesus Christ said, \\\"No, I don't know you. Because you pick and choose. You choose to do things when it pleases you. When in time of difficulties, you abandoned me, you didn't know me.\\\" So for those people that do not practice consistently, and the word they use is persevere, that means from the beginning until the end, the same basic, the same practice. Yes, we're human beings, we struggle, we have faults, we have selfishness, we commit sins, we have anger, we are greedy, and lazy, but if we realize that we change, we change, we change. So, when you're talking about the saints, you know, are they holy? Many of them are sinners. But they changed their life, and they do better. Saint Paul, one of the closest apostles of Christ, before he arrested so many people because they believed in Jesus Christ and the teaching, or the practicing, is different from the Jews. And Jesus Christ appealed to him, \\\"Why? Why do you persecute me, why do you arrest the Christians?\\\" And Paul asked him, \\\"Who are you?\\\" And he said, \\\"I am Jesus Christ. You persecute me.\\\" And for three years, Saint Paul studied the life of Christ, and now he preaching about Jesus Christ, different from the Jews in the past. Saint Paul is one of the leading Pharisees, leading the Jews in the past. But he changed his life because he believed in the teaching of Christ. So many Saints are sinners, many saints are lepers, many saints are, you know, people in the past they can be king, emperor, they can be farmers, they can be widows, they can be anybody. They can be your father, your mother, my father, my brother, but if they die and they believe in Christ, they are saints, because they believe that, they are in heaven with God. So, what I try to share with you is, I'm not fighting against you, but you asked me a question, I explain to you my belief, my philosophy of life, what I believe in, and then I practice what I am practicing.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*After Soyun translates, Tathagata laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (translating for Tathagata):</strong> He says about the revival, even though ordinary people, you know, but if they have a level of will power, then they can show themselves after death. They can just through a wall and they can show their appearance to living people. But, it's impossible to the dead with real body.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I will believe because he show his appearance after three days. When I see Jesus through religion, then Jesus is a man in mystery. I never, never understand him as a bad man. But, if I see Jesus according to your words, then Jesus seems very dangerous man. So what we need now is that you revive Jesus not kill him. But, your preaching is to kill Jesus twice. When we speak \\\"God\\\" then we should converse with very correct definition of the word. Otherwise, we have misunderstanding and it's confusing. I told you before if somebody has only one spirit (soul), they never tell about God &ndash; they never make God stand. But when somebody has dead spirits in them, then the dead spirit always uses the name of God because they want to use (take advantage from) the living people's body. As you said, if Jesus made God stand, it means that Jesus had the dead spirit in him. And if he had the dead spirit in him, he had the same quality (similar quality) with the leader of Judaism, so in this case, he cannot be killed by them. If you ask me, \\\"How do you know this fact?\\\" then I can answer like this, \\\"In mathematics, the answer is fixed, and the answer is in question, and the world is also decided.\\\" So we can only find the way only through the problems, and in the universe there are too many objects that we can designate as God. So there's only difference how many &ndash; 10 million, billion, 20 billion&hellip;. Because of your wrong teaching, you make people who seeking for Jesus receive Holy Spirit. But this thing must be revealed very correctly. We have two kinds &ndash; body, and consciousness, and the body is the tool of consciousness, and consciousness always use own body and conscious performs what it wants by using body. In comparison, our consciousness is a car driver, and body is car. When the Holy Spirit enter to one's body, it means that there are two drivers in one body. When one drive, then the other one have a rest. There are in many, many cases, the spirit comes from outside, push out the original driver. In this case, one's own spirit (soul) doesn't act so the lacking of activities of the real soul (original soul) can't grow up and become done. So when somebody receives Holy Spirit, it means that serve for some dead people not for self. So this is for dead people, not the teaching for the living people. So I was very surprised when I found this fact. I can't distinguish this case: is this the Saint's action (behavior), or the ignorant's behavior? Because someone gives oneself to the other's soul and one's own soul is done. So is this the result of the holy mind or the ignorant? You seems nice person. So please, a person like you work on behalf of Jesus. This world is falling in extreme crisis. As the time of the world, very, very soon, this generation will face with the end, and the main powers that push the human world to the end are religions and universities. Unless religion and universities change, this humankind (human world) will have the end. So you shouldn't ridicule my words. I am a man who can see this world. If you test me, I can verify all the ways in the world of result through questions. Teaching of truth must be verified only by questions and problems. Teaching without certain questions is just cheating people. If you request me today I can tell you where is the way (where can you find the way) that you are looking for. If I give you wrong words, whenever, I'll take all the responsibility of them.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> That's why when he came to see me, I said I would like to give you some books to read so we have questions and discuss about it, and he said we read so many books already. So, when we ask questions to learn, we have to have common ground, so we can communicate. That's why I said I can give you the books so you can read and have questions to know about to the faith I believe in. You remember in the beginning when we were in the room over there?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, yeah, I remember&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> So that's why I said, you know, human we have searching for truth and for knowledge, okay, we have to use our brain, otherwise we become static, you know, stay put. We have to search, we have to ask questions, I agree that we have to ask questions, we have to learn, we have to know more. That's why there are so many means of learning. You can read books, you can talk, you can watch television or the news, but we have to learn everyday. We will not get satisfied with what we have, but how we put into practice what we believe in. That's the thing. I'm not disagree with him, I did not challenge him, but what I'm telling him is that we have to have some common ground, some common knowledge so we can discuss things. If we do not, then we can't go anywhere. So that's why when he said he would like to know more about Catholic faith, normally what we do is that you have a booklet or something as a common ground so we can talk, we can discuss. That's all I would like to say.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> You've already been here for 30 years, and I know you've read so many books and changed yourself a lot. I've seen you already. Then, what is the use to read books? I could know everything in the book through you. But the books that you've read don't have anyone that is beneficial for human life. And proof, I can have game with you, if we bet about our talking. I own about 40 million baht. I can bet 10 million for a game. You only bet 1,000 baht. Let's make a loser and a winner. When I ask you 100 questions, if you give me one right answer, you are winner. In return, you give me 100 questions, if I have only one wrong answer, then I'm loser. It doesn't matter, you have another priest and discuss with them about 100 questions. So, if you make 10 in a group, then only 100 baht each. I would like to start this game this afternoon directly. Then, maybe I can take your money 800 baht. Tomorrow, I'll have less. If you want, then I'll make a call to London and transfer my money here. How about you? Do you have any intention for this game?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> You already do not understand about my life. I am religious, I am a priest, and we have three vows. Poverty, obedience, and chastity. Chastity, that means I am single all my life. I cannot have any family, no girlfriends&hellip;. Second, obedience. That means I have a boss. I am a pastor here but I have someone higher. So if the person change me here and there then I have to go. I cannot stay here forever. I cannot pick and choose what I like. The other one is poverty. When I use the money, I have to ask someone. I do not have money of my own. If I get the money, I have to put in commons so people can use that too. So&hellip; I lost the bet already because I have no money. I have to obey and you know, so I have no freedom to practice, you know, betting, or questions, and that type. But you are so generous. Okay? And I thank you so much for it. It's very nice to talk to you and you share your thought and you ask questions, I try because we are in limited times, so I share with you what I believe. I cannot impose on you, 'you have to believe'&hellip; So, thank you so much, because I have to have lunch and after that I have the function in the church. So I'm sorry that we didn't know ahead of time so we can schedule, we can talk, but thank you so much.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I was very pleased to meet you.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> If I got 40 million, I don't know what to do with the money.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Priest laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If I meet Jesus, I'll give to him.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>C:</strong> Thank you so much.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">Recorded in 2004.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></div> </div>\";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<div class=post_body><p> </p><p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Tathagata: </strong>I came to Thailand</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Director:</strong> Came from Korea?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> because I wanted to be helpful for your people.

I am leaving this country with one question. I still don't understand why you only try to learn meditation that's wrong, but you don't try to learn Buddha's teaching that is so good?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> This is his question.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Director:</strong> Then&hellip; what do you mean that&hellip; of learning meditation is not good, but learning Buddha's teaching is good.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, so good, no problem&hellip; but meditation is the cause of lots of problems</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> What is the problem with that?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Meditation is activities that you call the dead people enter to your body.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> When they practice meditation, then this is the way that they let the dead souls come in.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> You don't know me&hellip;. When I see things, I can see all the problems that are in the thing and I can see the result of the problems. If you deny my words I show you (I suggest you) all the evidences. If somebody speaks something to me with their understanding, then they also should show me the evidences of their knowledge.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> What I'm wondering is that the difference between meditation and the Buddha teaching &ndash; what do you mean by that, what is the difference? Because Buddha teach also meditation, not only teachings something else a path from meditation, because meditation is one step forward &ndash; one step to reach Enlightenment. Without meditation, you cannot reach Enlightenment in the Buddha teachings.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> In the Buddha's teachings</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> This&ndash; this is&hellip; to me!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Ah&hellip; to you. You understand like this.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Yeah. Because one is <em>sila</em>, or we can say that cultivation of ethical conduct that is the beginning&hellip; the basic&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> There's no one who could attain Enlightenment by meditation or no one who could be devote helpful to society by practice meditation. So, many meditation is the only way to receive the dead souls and lose themselves. I stake my life if these words are wrong. The truth must be verified by the proof. So if a person like you are not interested in checking this truth, then in this country, who will want to check? We just came back from confirmation. We've just met meditation master and I found (I saw) there were many of dead souls in his body. I told him, \\\"You have many of souls in you.\\\" He denied.&nbsp; So I answered him, \\\"What do you obtain from meditation?\\\" \\\"Peace.\\\" And when we talked there were 5 people together. But his face was worst among 5 people and his face itself was very dark. So if the meditation is really good then the appearance (the result) must come the opposite way. The fact is like this. Then how can you show us (how can you verify for us) that is good?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> See&hellip; In the Buddhist way, Buddhism, Buddha explained the way which are eight all together, eight factors&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Eight factors</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Yes. Which is called the middle way.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Middle way</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> What is middle way?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> In the middle way, the middle way, the middle between the two. There are two other ways which people used to follow before Buddha found this middle way. One is the way to enjoy life &ndash; enjoy material things &ndash;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Ah&hellip; enjoy material things&hellip; heh</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> And the other way is to harm oneself.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> To..?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Harm, to harm</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> To harm self</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Because sometimes some people do like harming oneself, and not having food, you know, sitting for meditation without food and things, maybe for a long, long time. And these are two extreme ways in Buddhist point of view.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Are you telling a story for me or are you explaining Buddha's teaching?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Explaining the Buddha's teaching! Explaining the way, the Buddhist way&hellip; What I am going to talk is the Buddhist way. But you say, what are the other ways,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> But there are two ways before that. When Buddha himself found another way which is called the middle one.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> When you say middle way, then what do you mean by that? There are three ways. Then you should go that one way.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> In the middle</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> In the middle&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Not too much of enjoying life&hellip; okay&hellip; when you need food, you need clothes for your living, okay, material things you need to have that, but not to enjoy&hellip;. Not to enjoy, not to attach to that. You cannot attach of the color of your clothes but you know you use the cloth to protect your body from the heat, the cold, from the wind. That is the way. That is the Buddhist way. But not to attach to it</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Attach to this&hellip; ah</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*while Soyun is translating for Tathagata, someone knocks, enters, and speaks briefly to the director in Thai, and then in English*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Newcomer:</strong> Hello&hellip; You are from?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>&hellip; From Korea, England&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Newcomer:</strong> Ah, from Korea, England, also, I see&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Therefore we need to have, but not to attach. Okay? And we need to control, but not to harm. We need to observe the rule and regulation for our living, but not to attach and not to harm ourselves. That's what the middle is. Not too extreme both way.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> It's very interesting to talk to you but we don't think we can detain (hold) you for long time. So, do you mind if I try to awaken you?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Awake&hellip; what?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Awake what?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> To make you realize that you don't know anything about Buddha's teaching.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Well, I think that I know many things about Buddha teaching. Because I need to have time to explain.&hellip; whether it is right in your understanding, or it is right isn't the same.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T (amused):</strong> If you tell the truth to us then today you have great luck.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I came to Thailand one month ago and I searched all Bangkok for one month and I met so many monks, also Buddhist scholars, but I failed to meet someone who know Buddha's teaching. In order to meet someone who really know Buddha's teaching I gave a proposal. If there is one man who understands one thing of Buddha's teaching I decided to donate 10 million baht. Maybe today you will be the owner of that, maybe tomorrow I transfer my money to your account!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> I personally do not like having more of wealth. Okay</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Any more of ?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Wealth, or money&hellip; I live a very simple life as a Buddhist monk. Buddha teach us to live with a very simple life with three roles&hellip; With food collecting from the door of the people as a beggar</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes&hellip; as a beggar</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> And to live, you know, without hair&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mm&hellip; without hair</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> But at the same time you sacrifice yourself to help others.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mm&hellip; <strong>*translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Yeah, that's good&hellip;&nbsp; Buddha's teaching must have ways in it, and Buddha always spoke cause makes effect.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Of course. I agree!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Soyun laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> I understand the same thing.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If you have seen an elephant you should explain, you should be able to verify what an elephant is like to others. So, if that somebody can't like this, then we can't say he saw that &ndash; even though he saw that, he can't say he really saw that. Do you mind if I give you 10 questions, very simple questions, that we can read in the primary school textbook? We have a word, \\\"happiness\\\". What do you speak the happiness (for what)? If you have concern about the others' happiness, you should know about that. When you say happiness, what do you designate by that?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> The happiness is the state of mind&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> State of mind?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Of your mind without attachment.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Ah&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> And, without</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata begins to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> the defilements: greed, hatred, and delusion.&nbsp; When you reach that state of the mind which is pure, and without defilements&hellip; the major defilements are: greed, without greed, liking to have people to understand what you want to, liking to have people, you know, to do something, or, liking to have this, and that, you know? Because liking to have more cause suffering. Therefore, we have less and finally we have no greed, no anger, hatred, and no delusion. These are the quality of the Buddha himself.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Of Buddha himself</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Pure mind. The mind without defilements</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> There's no way in your answer. Nobody can arrive the state of happiness with such teaching. Okay, second is easier question&hellip;. In Buddha's teaching, we can meet the word, the truth. So what do you mean by that?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Truth, by truth?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mm&hellip; What do you designate by that word?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> There are two kinds of truth&hellip; in Buddhism. Ultimate truth, and the other one is just temporary understand by people, which is not real. And in other words, we can say that the truth which is very very important to understand, you know, to free ourselves from suffering or to reach what he said that&hellip; happiness&hellip; or whatever. &hellip; Peace. &hellip; And there are many truths which are not very important. Not very important for us to understand.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Not very important for you to understand?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> There are many, many other truths which are also the truth but not very important for us to understand.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> You have too many of knowledge&hellip; so only when you leave (abandon, throw away) all of them, you will start to see Buddha's teaching.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D (laughs):</strong> Okay&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Otherwise, it will be very difficult for you to learn the Buddha's teaching, to understand Buddha's teaching, but it is easy for you to deceive others by your knowledge. Okay. Third is easier than second. The word that people use most frequently is love. So what kind of things do you indicate by the word love ?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Love is the&hellip; a kind of, what we call in Buddhism is the feeling</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Feeling&hellip;&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> And it is you know, if this feeling is not being controlled by insight wisdom, that maybe wrong&hellip; that may create wrong loving. Love. &hellip; Many of, you know, many of parents love their children and they love without wisdom and then they support them to do many bad things by loving them. They support them by giving them, you know, material things, money, and things, and they spoil them by that, by that loving. In Buddhism, if we consider love there must be control by wisdom.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> It's too difficult to understand what you speak. When you observe this world we cannot find any result without cause. And the result always is created by cause. So, if I ask you, what is the cause of such result, then you always give answer in very different direction. You don't need be ashamed because you can't answer to my questions. Since my Enlightenment, nobody could answer to my questions in this world. If you really know Buddha's teaching, when I speak to you the effect, you should perceive the cause of them. And when I ask you the cause (tell you cause), then you should perceive the result in that cause. And you haven't attained that level</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Of course I myself can accept that, I did not attain&hellip; but, I'm trying as a Buddhist monk, I know personally that I still have greed, hatred, and delusion in my mind, but when I compare this to many of, you know, people, I can find that I am in a higher place than them.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Ah&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> And in the Buddhist rule and regulation, if one reach enlightenment, you are not allowed to tell that to the public. It is prohibited and it is a very heavy, heavy com&ndash; I mean&hellip; a very heavy offense.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Offense</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> And if one tell that to the public, he is no more monk, okay? He&ndash; that means he destroy his own monkhood. That is there in Buddhist rule and regulation.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> It sounds very strange.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Yeah, it is in the Buddhist teaching. It is real Buddhist teaching. In the path of rule and regulation. And of course, there are two paths in Buddhist teaching. One is rule and regulation which monks and all Buddhists must observe. And the other one is the teaching that you must follow and try to practice and try to, you know, we have, according to what he taught&hellip;&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> When I listen to you, I misunderstand that I am in dreaming. When I listen to you, I feel I am dreaming because when Enlightened teacher come, he or she can teach what is wrong, what is right. So if the Enlightened being never tell -</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Teaching and telling is something different. Telling that you are attaining&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Enlightenment</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Enlightenment</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Only</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Or teaching what you understand is something different. You can teach something but not tell that.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> According to your knowledge, then Gautama Buddha was very bad guy. And he called himself as Tathagata. When we say that I am Tathagata it means that I am a seer &ndash; I opened my eye &ndash; and I can see. And Tathagata means he attained the Supreme Enlightenment. So in Buddhist view, he was very bad because he even demanded others to call him as Tathagata, not Siddhartha. I would like to listen your opinion. In this present, is Thailand Buddhist work for the dead people or for living people?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Many, many questions&hellip; I personally, you know, understand the same thing that Tathagata, you know, who is attending the Supreme Enlightenment, I am agree. And one more thing, being the Tathagata, a Buddha, is something different from being the follower.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> That's right.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> And we are the follower.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata starts to reply after translation*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> But we can reach the same state of mind, what we call Enlightenment.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> So, you&hellip; sorry I didn't&ndash; I missed&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> See&hellip; we follow the same way, the middle way, which Buddha used to follow, and reach Enlightenment &ndash; Supreme Enlightenment &ndash; okay? And of course, we have the same quality of mind like the Buddha. But not the quality of reaching Enlightenment but not like him. Not <em>every</em> quality like him. Okay? Many of his disciples, you know, who did not reach Enlightenment says thing that \\\"I'm reaching\\\"&hellip; \\\"Now I am here, Enlightenment, I am,\\\" you know, \\\"being arahata,\\\" or what we call Enlightened people. In order to collect&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Collect&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong>&nbsp; fame&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Fame or money. It means they told lie</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Many, many, yeah, they tell lie, therefore Buddha laid down the rule and regulation. That is later!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> That is later ?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Yeah.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> So&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> The rule and regulation&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Is made by others</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Is made by</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> By Buddha</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> The Sangha.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, by Sangha, not from Buddha.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Buddha as the leader and all of his disciples should be have this kind of rule. Yes we should have. And after them, after them, you know, no one can tell that \\\"I'm the Enlightened one. I am capable as the Enlightened person.\\\" But you can teach the teaching of Buddhism.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I say myself I am the Enlightened, then is it wrong?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Of course, if you're a Buddhist monk. If you're saying that \\\"I'm a Buddhist monk\\\", a follower of the Buddha, but if you say something \\\"I am the great living beings\\\" or \\\"the great Buddha\\\", it's something different</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Something different?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> But if you are saying that I am the follower, the Buddha disciple, then you cannot say that.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Aha&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Okay? If you're saying you're a Tathagata, you're a Buddha, you are free to do that. It's something different.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Can you explain what an Enlightenment is?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> I have already explained&hellip; The state of mind, reaching the state of mind without defilements.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Ah&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Reaching the mind that is pure without defilements, without greed, without hatred, and without delusion. And the mind of compassion.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> He has completed wisdom?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> He has a mind which is pure. Pure from what &ndash; pure from defilement. Okay? And he has a mind with insight wisdom. He has a mind with compassion. Okay. These are three quality of one who say that I am Buddha.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*After Tathagata speaks, Soyun laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> You may feel my words is illusion but when I listen to you I just feel I am dreaming because I find your words are so illusionary. People speak whatever, but it's not right for them to speak something without proof or without witness (before they've seen). So, today, if the Buddhist monks say that I am the follower of Buddha then they should know even one thing of Buddha's teachings.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> They should.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> But I haven't met anyone who really wants to know Buddha's teaching properly and of course who knows Buddha's teaching. You gave us time to talk to you because you have good basis. But others are different from you. When I came to Thailand, I had the worst reception from professors in universities and the monks who has great fame. But when I walked Temple street then so many massage girls invited me <strong>*Satto laughs*</strong> and they say hello very kindly and hold my hand, even&hellip;. I found that their souls (of massage girls) are purer and cleaner than the souls of intellectuals and monk. So unless they smile at me then I probably already left this country. If I only pay 120 baht, then they give massage, give water and tea for one hour. And they are very kind and smile and offer many things. But I've never seen such phenomena through professors or monks. Everything in this world is predestined (is fixed). So the bad people never like good people. This is also fixed thing in this world.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Mm&hellip; hehe&hellip; Can you explain this fixed thing by explaining in connecting with the understanding of cause and effect? When you say it is fixed then it is something that when there's some cause, you know, when the cause of changing that kind of person to become good, you know, then it's impossible if it is fixed.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong>&nbsp; No, when cause change then the result will change as well.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> When you say fixed&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> But in the circumstance that cause is not changed, it will not change. You are not worried about what to eat, where to sleep, by selling Buddha. If real Buddha come visit you what will you do to him?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> To me he will never come.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> He will never come</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Yes. Because he is beyond the world but we are still in the world. We are still in the world and he is beyond the world. He never, never come back and he always said&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> He never come back&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Understanding his teaching is now you are seeing him&hellip; you are touching him.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Somebody can know only when they learn from teacher who knows but if they learn somebody who doesn't know, it's useless for 100 years, they're still in the state of ignorance. You've already had unbreakable barriers around you. It's true when Buddha has delivered himself from all the desires, then he is freed from rule of transmigration. But Buddha can come to this world again in the case of crisis of human beings. From today, I will hardly visit monks in Thailand to awake them but I would like to tell you truthfully who I am. I am in the manner of dignity in front of anybody because I can understand and I can perceive this world. But I am continue to travel around the world because I hope that I will find the way to help mankind.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Not finding&hellip; still not finding&hellip; Still searching?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> In spite of all the cold reception of human being, I continue my effort. I know the way but nobody are looking that way. I was in the center of Buddhas in my past life. And what I want to tell you is selling Buddha is your freedom. (It's up to you to sell Buddha or not.) But don't think that you could approach real Buddha. I always have two kind of messages. One is that I inform people that I attained the Perfect Enlightenment. The other message is that I tell about myself: when I was born, and how did I grow up, and why I had to come to this world and what is the process of that and what is my mission and what I have to do in this world. I'll give you two messages so please read them with your friends and if you are interested whether it is true or not then please try to check. If you have interest in me, then I will pay reward about that. My first promise for you is that I'll open your wisdom. And I'll protect you from the influence of the devils. You should remember doing something good is more difficult than doing something bad. I was born in this human world to save this world, but until now, I've never welcomed by anyone. I've never welcomed by my parents, my brother, sisters, my relatives, and my friends. But, I live for them. You cannot test my abilities with your level of power. It is impossible for me if I didn't have the position of Buddha in the past. You've learned something from others but I never learn from others. When I was a child, I went to primary school for a while. At that time, I learned how to read, how to write, very carefully.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> From&hellip; from&hellip; from&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> From the primary school teacher, but nothing more than that</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> But it's impossible for debating even though you have all the doctors or the intellectuals put together (but it's impossible between us to debate something). When somebody ask or somebody answer in this course we need to present the evidences</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Evidences and&hellip;<strong> *asks Tathagata in Korean*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Evidences in the questions.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Mm&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> But it's impossible for human beings to do like this because they don't have Enlightenment. That's why nobody can answer to my questions. But if you ask me, I can realize anything, anytime. If somebody compare my ability to Gautama Buddha's, then this is a mistake. I think you as my friend so I will tell you who I was. My former being was Amida Buddha in the center of Paradise. So my former self was in the center of Buddhas. That's why I can know all the Buddha's teaching. I also can know the secret of this world that even other Buddha's didn't mention. I saw this current Buddhism, that's why when I die, I will tell to my people around me, \\\"You shouldn't (you <em>never</em>) let me put the object of religion.\\\" Whatever you do has no relationship with Buddha. So no matter how you sell them, but what you do doesn't have any connection with any of Buddhas. If there is one thing that Buddha want from you it's that there even one of yours what you want to know what real Buddha teaching is. I only can tell by those Enlightenment you please devote and contribute to help people. Yesterday we arrived in this city&hellip; _______ [Transcription note: Couldn't get this entire sentence. @1:05:26]. Today we've met a few of monks so if I tried more to meet monks then it will make me sad.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*someone begins to laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> So tomorrow we will contact the newspapers or broadcastings and we will ask them, \\\"Is there some truthful person here in this city? So can we have a chance to meet them and talk?\\\" Maybe the day after tomorrow I have some massages.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Soyun and Satto laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Most attractive thing in Chiangmai is the price of massage 120.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Cheap!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> In Bangkok, it's 150 baht. So this is 30 baht cheaper than Bangkok. This is very sad thing&hellip;. But I can't find any other alternative. I always visit so many places with my expectation but when I'm there I always regret 'why I came here?'</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Heheh</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata indicates to give the message to the director*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> So this is&ndash;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> But one thing is that when I'm helping people I always happy.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> You're always happy&hellip; heh&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> But not sad&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> But not sad</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Yeah, not sad, but happy&hellip; welcome people, I welcome you are here&hellip; Don't be sad.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*some laughs and Tathagata replies*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (Laughs while translating for Tathagata):</strong> But if you are in his position, you can't speak like that&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Because I am a sort of follower of the Buddha.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Really</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> We carry on the same message. And being Buddha, as I say that, one quality is loving kindness and compassion - whoever, no exception.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Don't deny until you check the truth of this message.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Of course! Of course&hellip;Very very happy to accept or just take some information and try to read it, try to understand, that is the duty of, you know, all Buddhists. But because Buddha said that don't be in very, very position&hellip; I mean&hellip; to believe&ndash; don't jump into belief. If&hellip; If one who is telling that story to you is your teachers. It is on &ndash; don't jump into belief because it is written in the book and don't jump into belief because that story is reasonable by logic. Therefore I am accepting&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> You seem to remember one thing. This is right because the human beings speaks lie too easily so don't trust what they speak. But it's not right as well if only deny without checking (without confirmation)&ndash;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Of course. What&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> what it is.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> What I am saying is that don't jump into belief 'till you get all information and then try to check by your own practice.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Ah&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Okay? Same thing. I agree with him.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> It's impossible for somebody to confirm if they don't know the world. I'm trying so much to make people realize (also now) because you shouldn't be deceived by word and so when you are not deceived you can accept good, you don't accept bad. But you don't know what kind of ordeals do they have when I grow up. Because the destiny of the world put on my shoulder so that's why I cannot give up. Now (at the moment) I work, but after I die, past Buddhas, Jesus, any other Saints or gods (high gods) are nothing compared to me.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (translating):</strong> So, his life will remain forever through his teachings.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Today, I came to you and this fact will also be a good teaching for future. Please read that message and after reading, if you want to see me again, then you can find me where I am. We will stay in Chiangmai for two days more, but there is telephone number in England. Then they will know where I am</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Would you like to give it to me?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Or not to me directly&hellip;. Just to put it here?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> No, I gave you</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Just give it to me? &hellip;&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Ok</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Thank you</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Hehe&hellip; because I know one thing that in this country the woman shouldn't give this to the man (monk) directly.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> You see, it is some kind of attachment.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mm&hellip; So that's why I feel it very strange, very pretend to someone</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*D laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> You see actually in the Buddha teachings, in the rule and regulation, from your heart that is very very important. With sensual pressure, you touch woman, you touch with, even the animal, the male&ndash; female animal &ndash; even then, not only woman. But now, we are friend, yes?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes, friends</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Not as sensual, you know, desire, sensual pressure&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Alright&hellip; I see&hellip; hehehe</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> And I think you know the story of Zen Buddhism</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Zen Buddhism?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mm, yes&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> One master carry</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Ah yes, carry</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> The girl</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> The woman&hellip; haha</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Woman, 'cross the river&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah&hellip; it's a different&hellip; situation&hellip; heh</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Satto laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>&hellip;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Thanks!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T (without Soyun having translated): </strong>There must be ways in teaching so if there's no ways in teaching that teaching is dead. But in your scriptures (your Buddha scriptures) those ways have reappeared. It is not beneficial to people you learned scriptures and teach scriptures. When I met a Muslim lecturer and he asked me, \\\"How many rivers in heaven?\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*D laughs continuously for about 15 seconds*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> So I told him, \\\"I still don't know how many rivers in my country, then how can I know how many rivers in heaven?\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*all laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T (laughing):</strong> He said, \\\"But we know because Allah told us how many rivers in heaven, it's written in Quran.\\\"&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> So I told them, \\\"I don't know what kind of crazy person wrote like that but what is use for people the knowledge of how many rivers in heaven?\\\" So we were in danger because they thought we insulted their religion. It happened in Africa for us.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> And then what is&hellip; what do you want people to do in your way?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I hope you _______ live on right way ____________. [Transcription note: Couldn't make out some of this as there is some movement @ 1:19:20]</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> And what is that right way?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> When you open your eye by yourself to the world, you can understand. In order to get good result, we need good cause. All the bad result comes because they have bad cause. Buddha said the original reason of sin is ignorance. You receive as meditation is good and you are cheated by ghosts. The present world will be disappeared (will be end) 14 years later.*</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> 14 years after this?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> That means I'm living&hellip; only up to&hellip; 200&ndash; 2000-something&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Hm?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> 14 years from now</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> The world will be&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Will be end</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> End&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Disappear</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Uh, let's see, let's see&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> In Buddha's words we have the word transmigration. What exists always repeats forever by the activities of 'what is'. This world itself turn round again and again by what happened in it like the hand of this watch, and the time of the world is approaching 12. And this world could exist forever by this kind of periods. The aim of my activities is to save humankind. In spite of all hardships, I continue my traveling. The reason is that the way to save yourself is <em>in</em> yourself (in self). So I am wandering (traveling) round the world to reveal this way. If you are not looking for the way I can't open the way for you. The current religions (all of the religions) act for dead people. And all the universities has same activities to lead this world to the end. So the main bodies that push this human world to the end are universities and religion. So I don't have any method (any ways).&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Heh</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Any ways to carry my mission&hellip; May I go to street, with naked,</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*someone laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> then people will look at me, 'What happened to the man?' So, I prepare to just go jump into the mass and I show them the evidences about what leads to something wrong and what kind of result will they have from their doing things. I have real one thing that want to tell you. Don't do practice meditation much, don't read Buddha scriptures, and there are many traps to destroy you. So become just a pure general person. The best way to live in this modern society is that just you receive others' situation, understand them, and if you can, help them just as the position of general people. Because at the moment the religion is the dead one that's why if you really want to become a right person then you may lose your position in this. The more important thing than your current position is your own soul. If you really want to save you I'll help you and I can educate you as the most excellent one in this country.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Hehe</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> So, like me, when you open your eye to the world, you become very grand in front of anyone. And even though you don't learn from others, you aren't with old theories, and you will not deceive others. When you make up your mind, I will get contact. Please read that message when I leave here. If you find yourself being interested in the life of Buddhas then please visit me like I visit you. I have been attacked so many from the world of devils. If I had the very common ordinary soul, how I can defeat the army of devils and continue this work? When your soul become brightened, then you will find all the evidences of me. If you can see me with your spiritual eye, then you will find the very shining (very glorious) light from me. But not everyone can see such beauty. You never deny who I am&hellip; in my forehead, we call this <em>sarira</em> as the 'eye of wisdom'. But it never appear among everybody. It can appear from only one being in one world. In spite of all these evidences, if you still deny me then we don't have any point. In case you visit me, bring even one bottle of Coca Cola<strong> *Tathagata laughs*</strong>&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> This is a manner to Master</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> To me, I'm not having coca-cola&hellip; because that is the material things people produce and kill many people</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Ah&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*people begin to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Because it kills them inside&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata laughs loudly*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> It's not natural soda!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (laughing):</strong> Not natural things&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Yes&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Ah! He says that,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Even though I'll be killed by the Coca cola that you served, but I'll be still happy that I had treatment from you</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*all are laughing*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> So&hellip; don't worry about me,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> No&hellip;? &hellip; You know if you love a master,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mm?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> you should love them in the way you treat them. Not the thing to kill them&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Oh&hellip; <strong>*translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> No? Never happen like that. Because these American people, you know, Coca Cola, Pepsi, American people produce, and try to, you know? Try to advertise saying that if you take Coca Cola, you are the best, the best, the best!&hellip; you see, that is the world of materialism&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah&hellip; that's not real&hellip; real demand&hellip;&nbsp; For example, if you come,&nbsp; __________ <strong>*Tathagata is speaking*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> We are staying in a hotel, People's Place, it's just opposite Holiday Day</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Chiangmai Holiday&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Villa</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah&hellip; Maybe you will know Chiangmai Plaza Hotel, it's ____________ <strong>*movement occurs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If you have good friends then you can visit me with some questions you really want to know about this world.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> But right now I have a question.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (laughing): *translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Hehehe&hellip; My question is&hellip; how to open the eye? This is very, very deep question that I know that you don't want to answer this.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> How do you know before you listen?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Because he says&hellip; because he say that he will never tell people till you are ready to&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> The secret is very simple. But it may be very difficult to practice. All the creature is born on the basis what happened to them in the past. We call it karma &ndash; what was in the past. But it will very difficult for you to repress your karma by yourself. But it's very simple only when you can suppress them by yourself. Only when you leave (throw away) all your falsehood, then the things will start to be seen to you. From that time, your mind become brightened and the real peace occurs to you. It's the way to make you be Enlightened: when you see 'what is' then from that time you don't speak lie. You only speak people what you've seen. When you begin to see what it is really then your conscience and your courage just produced in your mind. From that time you can devote yourself to awake others. By those efforts, you can make yourself emancipate and you can stand on the way of Buddha. First of all, meet a man of truth, and next you listen and observe what he speak, what he does. Then after about 2 years, then you start to see</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> 2 years</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> to see 'what is' and understand.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> And if I die before that? Hehe&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Only 2 years?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Because you say 14 years to remain&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I have ability if you really want to save yourself I can expand your life. Because your soul is the owner of your body so if I give a little of my power to your soul your body never die.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Never die means?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> No, even though you have a destiny to die, but he can help&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D,S:</strong> to expand</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> To some years&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Without even such ability, how do I wondering all this world? Imagine, because I don't find the way to find people who really want to learn&hellip; wherever, in this temple, by universities&hellip; if I meet anyone then I just say \\\"Shall we make a bet?\\\" I showed those kind of activities because I want to help them to realize. But nobody challenged</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> to my proposal. That's why I couldn't help anybody to realize.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> One more thing that it seem that&hellip; the way to open the eye is to understand what it is&hellip; something like that. And then without concentrate mind, how can one realize or how can one open one, you know, own eye?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> There are waves because of the activities of karma of everybody. So if you can stop the activities of your karma, then it's like just the blind open their eye.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> I don't understand&hellip; how can stop that karma?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> First of all, you need to meet a truthful person and listen, see, and you realize something in the world and you see and awake and realize what it is.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:</strong> I mean, to&hellip; to stop our karma first, first of all, right?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Hm? Yes?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>And then going to the master&hellip; to the truthful person&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> No, no, no&hellip; that's not right&hellip; <strong>*translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata asks Soyun something in Korean*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> The first condition is meeting a truthful master.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>It is to open the eye&hellip; okay? In order to open your eye, you have to go to the truthful person? To meet with&ndash; right?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Yes, that's right.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>And then? Listening&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Once you open your eye you go by yourself, you are independent. When you are blind, even though a big log in front of you, you can't see that. But when you open your eye, if there's a log you just avoid that and go. When you close your eyes you can't see a river. But when you open your eye, you can see waters (river). Then when you want to cross river, you can find method there. Only when you open your eye you can realize what it is. My teaching is much easier than Shakyamuni Buddha's teaching and very distinctive (very clear).&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Without concentrate mind, then how can we open our eye? This still doubt in my mind. Without concentrate mind&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Concentrate the mind <strong>*translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> No, it's impossible for you to be Enlightened even though you practice 10,000 years by concentrating. There is a way to arrive the result through questions.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Through? Through</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Through the questions (problems)</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Through the question</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes, through (by)</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Through, yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If you don't see by yourself then it will be extremely difficult for you to find out anything by yourself. For example, it's simple farming, but you just sit on forest and concentrate how can I cultivate very nicely, but it's very, very hard to find the way. The best is that you just go farmer and see what farmer does there and learn from him how you cultivate. That's the <em>best</em> way (<em>quickest</em> way). You see what truthful person does and what truthful person speak, this the best way (this is the best learning&hellip; from his action, from his work, speech). When you know something more, then you protect yourself more from making mistakes. But more you don't know, more you are cheated. So when you know more, it's more easier for you to free from the influence of karma.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">Let's have a very simple example. You start to learn mathematics&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Okay</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Before you learn, when you see 5 + 5, you can't understand what it is. Because you don't understand the questions that's why you never find what answer that question has. So it's useless you <em>concentrate,</em> concentrate on the question or think over, again and again. But when you learn that, and when you become understand the figures (numbers) then when you see the question you know what is answer. Then when somebody tell you, \\\"Oh, 5 + 5 makes 11\\\" but you don't believe it. Without thinking you just can realize, \\\"No, the answer is 10.\\\" You don't need to think about that. Everything is the same ways. So if you really need&ndash;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>One&hellip; one more. Heh.&nbsp; One more question.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Oh, ok, last sentence&hellip; In the last sentence he said,</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If you really need Enlightenment, and if you truly want to save you, then you probably will bet this position. If you want to save yourself then lots of obstacles will stop you. This young man, Satto, had planned to join this traveling. When he decided that, something happened. His mother and his wife made lots of problems (trouble). And many things happened that ordinary people can't understand. When somebody wants to do something good, there must be many obstacles. That's why you need to discuss with some friends around you and try to confirm.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> What is your question?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>The question is, to me, the teachings of the Buddha, one teaching of the Buddha is that he take,&hellip; he's&hellip; you know, this teaching is really, really my concern&hellip; with concentrated mind, okay?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> His teaching?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> (Gautama Buddha's)</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>And one is cultivation of ethical conduct, that's one. And mental discipline is the next one, and insight wisdom is the last one. Okay? And these three, you know, support each other. If you have insight wisdom, that support you to do good things, doing good things support you to have concentrate mind. And he compare the concentrate mind like water. ...</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Like water&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Which is calm&hellip;.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mm.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Okay? Without that&hellip;&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>&hellip;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Let me explain&hellip; let me explain all. Not the question now. I am just tell what I understand from the teachings of the Buddha, what I learned from the teaching of the Buddha is that meditation or the concentrate mind is really important. Like the water which is calm. Okay? But our mind, if your mind is in trouble, jumping from here and there, here and there, that make us not to go further to the insight wisdom. Similarly, with the water, which is _______ [1:58:00], we see deep inside of such water, we cannot find things. Or even when we can find things inside, it is not really clear. Okay. He compare concentrate mind with calm water. Can you explain something about this?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (interpreting):</strong> You say the calm water can reflect?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Not reflect&hellip;&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Can see</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Can see things inside.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Inside. Things inside.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>And clear things inside</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> It doesn't seem Buddha's words&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>It's not the Buddha's words?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> No</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Because something that doesn't move going bad. So even water, it doesn't act (move), it become to decay.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>But there is something different from what I am explaining. I'm not saying about the water which is dead. But the water which is without wave, is like a mind without disturbance. Mind with <em>concentration</em></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes, I know, that's what you understand. ___________________ [Master Tathagata begins speaking, 2:00:00]</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Buddha always emphasized you should confirm anything but you can't see (you can't know) things by only concentrate.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>That's what I'm saying. Concentration means four. Okay? For right understanding. Okay? That is the right&ndash; what I understand. Not we just concentrate. Okay? Not to just concentrate. If just concentrate, it is like Hinduism, like Brahmanism, and like other ascetic before. But after having to some extent you have concentrate mind. Like now, I have a concentrated mind, to try to listen to you, this because of concentration. Therefore I understand what you are saying, or what you are talking about. Without concentration, then how can I understand what you are saying? That's what I mean. &hellip; To some extent I mean.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> But&ndash;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>I also, you know&hellip; I also against those people who always just concentrate. I also against that.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> People say the face is the window of mind.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Yes&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Today I visited the temple that there is&ndash; they teach meditation. But I couldn't find anyone who has a bright face.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Hehe.. yes. I also experience the same.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> But&ndash;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Someone comes in and speaks with the director for a moment*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> &ndash; they didn't realize the effect. But I could see that among them, inside them, there are the dead souls.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Heh. Yes&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> But they have to the same thing for dead souls. But as the result, they will lose their own souls. So I told them, \\\"You have great compassion.\\\" because I can't tell them directly. Your mind of compassion (kindliness) is better (much better) than Gautama Buddha's. I've never read that Gautama Buddha gave his body to the poor dead souls in record. That's why you have bigger compassion than Buddha. The master we met already lost his self, so he didn't understand what he talked. I told him, \\\"If I ask you, 'sing west', then you always answer, 'sing east.' Then how can you be helpful to people to realize what do they do (what they are doing)?\\\"&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (interpreting for Tathagata, who begins to laugh with Soyun):</strong> When he spoke this, here is a monk who guided us to the car. From here we started. So, he was very upset and he said that, \\\"I'm going!\\\" but we didn't have any car, so that's why we had to follow him, \\\"Please, let's go too!\\\" Hahah.. So we arrive here again, you know&hellip;&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Everybody has very weak will. That's why they are badly used by dead spirits. You are very smart but you made lots of mistake. Because you already have your spiritual guide in you but you can maintain this circumstance because you are not a person with weak will. So I tell you the way of praying. When you pray by yourself, without persons, you pray like this. You don't need to call Buddha or Bodhisattvas. You have to pray to your guidance, \\\"I am not sinner, I don't have much sin, so please let me go, let me be free.\\\" Otherwise you will be under of the influence of that guidance. How can I know the secrets that you even don't know much? During our conversation, I felt something blocked here.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Where, here?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Within myself &ndash; in me? Right here</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Mm.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I can perceive immediately it was not your own energy</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Okay</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If I don't perceive even such thing, then I'm always in trouble during my traveling. In this world there is only one being that the dead souls can't invade carelessly. It move _______ [2:11:09], then I can just pursue where it is. It will influence to you in the future a little. Wrong teachings all cause this kind of damage. You don't need to practice meditation and read Buddha scriptures. I tell you one secret of Buddha scriptures&hellip; When you read something if they don't have any questions then they are not useful. All the ways to attain the result stay in questions. Any contents doesn't have the questions then we can see there is no way to the result. In Buddha scriptures, it is read as \\\"You should live good\\\" but there's no way how we can live good. So it's useless however they repeat and again 100 times \\\"you should live good\\\". There are lots of traps in such words. If somebody try to make them realize by reading books then they will waste their whole life. And the present Buddhism is the dead one. Some people say they can be Enlightened through practicing meditation but it means that sometimes the ghost enter them and they make the one can see something behind wall. Ignorant people think, \\\"oh, their mind has very high enlightenment because he can see and we can't see\\\" but the ghost can perceive that. So they are just deceived by ghosts. Enlightenment means they become master to the world. They can perceive the questions (the problems) about how this world exists and what are in the questions. They perceive such things. All the cause of all the answers is the questions. How can I expand your life? How can I give you Enlightenment? This is very simple. I just realize what problems you have and I just change the problems that you have. When problems change, the answers change as well. The difference of me between others is that to perceive these things. So don't deny my words&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Yeah&hellip; but to me, one thing that come to me is that, when Buddha explained his Enlightenment, you say that it is difficult to do and this is impossible in this world.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> In this?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>In this world now, in this present world</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Okay?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> No&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Right? No?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> No, the best thing now is to make people realize and guide them to good way (right way). Awakening people, this is the best one. Even though you wish to help people awaken, but if you can't see the world, if you don't understand the world, you can't do that.&nbsp; So if you really want to know something among possible things then you should go the person who know that. If you want to do computer then you should go to person who know more than you. If you want to learn how to be a driver you should learn from the person can drive. We can learn nothing just by sitting. This is just make self be cheated. When you listen something that you don't know, that you don't understand, then you should demand them to show the evidences.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>One is not&hellip; regarding this&hellip; What I am trying to, you know, to explain and get maybe, you know, the answer is that, he said that, the teachings of the Shakyamuni Buddha is now, you know, no more&ndash; is the dead teachings</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Dead</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Right?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mhm, yes.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Which cannot be practiced</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mhm</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Like that&hellip; but to me, what I have learned, when Buddha teach about doing good, he explained many things prior to that. He explained that if you are a good &ndash; if you are, you know, practice as a Buddhist, even you are a seller, you are a traitor, you should avoid selling out.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mm&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>You should avoid selling poison&hellip; You should avoid selling human beings. Avoid selling meat. Many things. And you should observe five precepts. Abstaining from killing, from stealing, from telling lie, from taking intoxicating drink, and many things, you know, are being explained after that. So then how come you say that this is now the dead teachings?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Dead teachings&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*translates*&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> No, Buddha is not ignorant like you.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Hm?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> People do bad because of their karma.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Can they change that karma? Or they cannot change?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Yes! Buddha gave 5 basic precepts but it's very difficult for ordinary people to keep them because everybody has their different karma so this is because of the influence of karma it's very hard for them to keep that. Everybody has their own different karma so how can people become good one because somebody say, \\\"You should do good.\\\" If somebody says, \\\"You shouldn't do good\\\" but how can good people become changed bad because of that words? It is true that when religion started, they gave precepts. We can make only two gist of Buddha's teaching. One is theory of transmigration. He explained how this world become into being by what kind of principle. And he revealed about the law of cause and effect. He told (he informed) where is the origin that make things better or worse. If it is really living Buddhism, then it must make people to realize of them.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>That means no one realize</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, no one realize that Buddhism is dead</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Nobody who is now alive the one who realize</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> The one who realize</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> My duty is not one of Buddha's. I didn't come here as a Buddha, I came to the world as a savior.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Not a Buddha?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> His role is not just the Buddha's. He came here as a Messiah.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (interpreting for Tathagata):</strong> He was forced to come into human world, not by his will. (He was not willing to come here in this age.)</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> He was forced to come here.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Forced by?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> He was forced coming into human world</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>By whom?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> By whom? <strong>*translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I applied by myself, I volunteered to come to this world</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>You say forced?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Yeah, he explain now</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> By this situation</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Huh?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> By the situation</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>By the situation</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I told you I was the Buddha in Paradise, it means that I was a teacher all the gods.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Yes&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> In Paradise, there was a conference to decide something but it was the meeting of some higher gods, but they can't demand the main Buddha to attend there or not. What I'm talking now is in my message (pamphlet). I saw that nobody volunteered to come into the world to save mankind. That's why I had to come.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>But many people, to me, many people said, \\\"I am coming to this world by&ndash; in order also to save the world\\\" like prophet Mohammad, like Jesus Christ, and like Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h. And they also claimed the same thing.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*upon receiving translation, Tathagata laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> But Jesus was the same level of Bodhisattva. But Mohammad, he gave his body God (he received some spirit). If they came to save this world, they should leave some teachings how they could save this world. But I've never seen any teachings from them through their lives.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>In Bible?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> In Bible</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>In Quran?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> In Quran&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> In Quran, in Bible, there are no matters (no problems) there. All of those scriptures were written by some people who had ghosts. That's why those books leave so much damage to people's world.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>And also include the Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Who is Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>You don't know Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h? Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h is the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; teaching.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Oh, Bah&aacute;'&iacute;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h is the name of&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> God</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>the prophet</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> The prophet, yeah&hellip; ah&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>That came to the earth and claimed that I am&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Bah&aacute;'&iacute;&nbsp; <strong>*translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>also, yes&hellip; And to serve and the world savior&hellip; I am now coming to the world to save the world</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I've visited Bah&aacute;'&iacute; house in England. Because we didn't find any place to visit there, so we had to go there. When I saw what they did, it was so ridiculous. In order to awake them, I made play with them. At that time, a man who charged that house came to us. He drove away the people around&hellip; He invited us to come to his house and he invited some friends and his family there. And he asked to me things about the world. And he just request me to bless them with my hand. He didn't talk anything else. I've also met the popes, sankaracharyas of Hinduism, but sankaracharyas, they also ran away when we talked.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Hehehe&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I met many great gurus in India, but there's one who kneeled to me. He was the best looking and he spoke so fluently. It is impossible if I want or not the main Buddha. It will be mistake if you see me in the same level of Jesus or Shakyamuni Buddha.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>But now you see even Bush, the president Bush, he's also saying that he came also that, he will save this world&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (laughs): *translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Right? Because he is now ruling the world&hellip; trying to control the world&hellip;. Then what is his idea about this? Does he claim that he can save the world?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> No, Bush doesn't have intention to rule this world. He is the president of America. As the president, he pursues their own profit. But I can say if he is right or not only when we talk on the certain problems. But he is in very difficulties because he invaded (he attacked) Iraq without understand Iraq. The thing in the world exists in the problems. So we can make bad world change into good world, on contrary, good world also can be changed into bad world by problems. When I see this world, the world is perfect. I don't have anybody to compete to me with all parts of things in the world like politics, economics, religion, philosophy, medicine, besides Buddhism. For this work we don't have special donors. I have to prepare all the expenses for this work in right way. When I attend some people to help me like translator or&hellip; then I have to pay all of them. And I've never received any money from others in unright way. When I need money I do work like many other people. When I work, then people are very frightened (surprised). I could solve everything to _______ [@2:39:45] way even though I never experienced such kind of things, because I am very well trained. When I came to the world, I had unspeakable ordeals. When we come to travel, Satto&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> His name is Satto</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Satto had question why the Enlightened Master like woman very much?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*all laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Because we always smile at women!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> It passed 20 years since I obtained my Enlightenment.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Years?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> But most of people (almost all of the people) run away from me (looked away). But, those girls smiled at me and they call me, \\\"Come!\\\" So now I am quite&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> What's that&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Well</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mm&hellip; yes.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> \\\"I have another vitality\\\", you know?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> To survive</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Where are those girls?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Those girls? Those girls&hellip; massage girls&hellip; hehe&hellip;&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Well it is very different from the Sakyamuni Buddha&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Very different? <strong>*laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Because he himself, after getting Enlightenment, only one, only two months after, only seven weeks&hellip; two months he preached to five monks and they follow his footstep&hellip; and after that, just only 9 months, the number of his follower are 1,250. They gathered and tried to plan how to work and how to spread this message to the public and to let them understand and to let them&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> You mean the five months later?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Nine months later!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Nine months later&hellip; 1,250?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Followers</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Oh&hellip;<strong> *translates and someone laughs quietly*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D:&nbsp;</strong> But in 20 years many people run away&hellip;!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> So that's why he says that's just opposite way!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> After 2 months since my Enlightenment, I lost my friends.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*all begin to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> And after 9 months later all my relatives stopped to visit me! So I didn't find anyone to talk, that's why I killed all my times as a drunk [Transcription note: This needs to be confirmed by the original Korean words.]. Where I visit, I had cold receptions. When I wake up in the morning, I didn't have any place to go. So I started to travel abroad, left my country that I can communicate. I have been trying very hard for 20 years, and now I have only about 10 people. And they don't follow me because of my teaching but follow me because of my abilities. But the people who follow me, among them, nobody died in 20 years, and their livings become very good. The Buddha that you mentioned stands just on the opposite way of me. <strong>*laughing*</strong> But I don't want to believe in what you said before. But when we see in record, Gautama Buddha died at Kushinagar. He died on the street during traveling. He traveled to find people. If he had so many followers with 9 months (already 1,250), then why he had to live alone? (very lonely)</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>How come you say alone? because the record say that there are many</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> No, lonely</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Monks</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Not alone&ndash; lonely&ndash; in loneliness</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>The record&hellip; you know, about his attendants, about his many of great followers, around when he died&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> In my message, there is one secret that you didn't know. When I opened my eye, I had a message from the very, very remote space. And the message carried to me with great ecstasy in my body. In those messages, here is one sentence. 'If someone knows the truth, he will be lonely; if someone tells truth, he will be cursed.' I know if I reveal the truth, all the human being will abandon me (they discard) but I don't give up revealing the truth because the way to save themselves are in the truth. Every day, in spite of cold reception from human being, I visit them, I try to tell them the truth. So sometimes, when I see myself, I'm very lonely. But, sometimes, I feel myself very proud. So today, we also tried to meet some people, but still we didn't have lunch. I'm okay, I am old, but he is very young, he must be very hungry <strong>*Tathagata laughing*</strong> If you have some question or doubt about me, then whenever you visit me then you check. If what I speak reveal as a falsehood, then I'll take all the responsibilities of my words. You probably have lots of friends in this city&hellip;.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> No?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Many friends&hellip; they are indeed, to me, really very good&hellip; They are very kind to me&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Any of Buddha call themselves as a Tathagata, not Buddha. If you want to see the living Tathagata, you have time of 2 days. Only he knows all the teachings of all the Buddhas and only he can find where is the way to achieve our wishes. So after reading that messages, and you have telephone there, so you will find where we are. I can give answers as long as you give questions to me. And I can tell you how you can understand such questions. You should know what you want to know first. If I don't tell you so that you understand what you want to know, no matter how many things I speak, it's useless. You can't compare to money when you become to know something that you didn't know. You will feel something when you read that message. If you don't have anything feeling then our relations will finish. People will know where the Chiangmai Holiday</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> You have the card? I can copy there the telephone</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> People will tell you where the Chiangmai Holiday Hotel is. We are staying in &hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> People's Lodge</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> People's Place Lodge</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> People's Place is a hotel&hellip; People's Place hotel</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> You can meet us there. If you can meet the next world then it will be the most honorable moment that you met me today in your life. Anybody who visits me must be ready to be broken. But if they make mind that they are not broken by me, then it's impossible to become friends. In the world of human beings, in the world of gods, there's no one who can argue with me about the truth. You can trust this one thing. Otherwise nobody can speak like this.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (translating):</strong> When we visit some place, if they show cold attitude, then he always says, \\\"If you can answer to my questions, then I'll give my life.\\\"&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> For 20 years, I always gave so big talk. But still my neck is&hellip; <strong>*laughing*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I hope your good life.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Thank you&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*movement and some conversation occurs, and a few moments later Satto takes a picture of the director with Tathagata*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> I will&hellip; with flash, it's better&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*one more photo is taken*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Okay&hellip; thank you</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>&hellip;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If somebody is looking for Buddha, please contact.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">* Recorded between Dec 18 and 20, 2004.</p> <p></p></div> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<div class=post> <div class=post_header> <h3>Conversations with three professors of philosophy and religion</h3> </div> <div class=post_body><p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>Professor 1: </strong>&hellip; Where are you now?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*a moment passes as the professor speaks on the phone*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>Tathagata (quietly):</strong> Today is quite successful.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>Tathagata:</strong> Nobody recognizes the principle of the world like the formula in mathematics.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1:</strong> Okay&hellip; Yes okay.

I visit every country in the world and I confirm (check) the problems of the reality in the present. I mainly contact the people who work in the parts of religion, education, and science. So I visited lots of universities and institutes. That's why I came to Thailand this time. I've met so many people in this country so far. But I didn't have any harvest from them.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1:</strong> Any&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Harvest.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1:</strong> Oh, harvest.

She said that you have very expensive school fee, and of course you have so good professors in this university. So, that's why, today we came here. I've visited more than 42 countries so far. Every countries I visited I met many excellent people.&hellip; maybe they are people introduced us that they are excellent.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1: </strong>Ah&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Heh&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> But, I didn't have opportunities to converse to talk to them with satisfaction. I don't know why, but whenever I give questions to them, most of them are silent.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Ah.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Or, if I don't give any questions to them, how I can check the problems in reality? I met so many professors around the world but I had only one philosopher who wanted to listen to me. When I visited Hungary, three main newspapers in Hungary recommended him to me. His name is Boid.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1:</strong> Spelling? B-E&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Boid&hellip; spelling? Spelling&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Boid.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Boid. B-O-I-D.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1: </strong>Oh, oh, B-O-I-D&hellip;. Boid, Boid.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> And he also was a professor in Free University in Germany. He spoke very sweetly and very fluently. So I asked him, \\\"What do you know about what parts?\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1:</strong> What about&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> About what part?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>Satto: </strong>\\\"Part.\\\" \\\"What do you know about what part?\\\"&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Of what department.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1: </strong>Of what department.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>Satto: </strong>About what matter.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1:</strong> Oh, \\\"what matter\\\". Oh. Oh&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T: </strong>And he answered to me that, \\\"Oh, I don't know anything.\\\" So I told him like this, \\\"People don't know that they don't know.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1: </strong>Ah&hellip; haha&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T: </strong>But at least you know that you don't know anything.\\\" So he requested us that, \\\"When I have a hard problem, can I ask you?\\\"&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S: </strong>So he said \\\"Yes, you can.\\\" , so he has his address and name card&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T: </strong>To become a philosopher, they need purity in mind. But, the present philosophers lost their purity in spirit. They don't try to see the world of philosophy by the principle and the problems. But they always make the logic. That's why they transformed philosophy. When we have correct understanding of philosophy, then it's very easy to teach and easy to learn and very easy to use them practically. You surely have learned and taught philosophy for a long time. You may be embarrassed if I give you a very basic question.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1: </strong>Ah, no problem. Yeah.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> No problem? Heh</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> But that's not your fault. If somebody has seen an elephant, they will be able to recognize when they see elephant again. And they will be able to explain what the elephant is like so that they can verify what they saw. Then, if you don't mind, I'd like to ask a very basic question. In case if you can't answer to me, then don't hate us&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*people begin to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> It will be very, very important chance for you.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1:</strong> Okay.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> First of all, you've learned philosophy, you teach philosophy. Could you tell me the definition of philosophy? (When you say philosophy, what do you designate?) If you learned the philosophy from somebody who knows philosophy, then you know this answer immediately. But, if you learn from somebody who doesn't know philosophy, then this answer will be very difficult.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*Tathagata chuckles*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1: </strong>Yeah&hellip; okay&hellip; <strong>*a moment passes*</strong> I don't know&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*all begin to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1:</strong> But first of all&hellip; I would like to ask you first, do you want any coffee?&nbsp; Coffee?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Coffee!</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes, please.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1: </strong>Our school, you know, our curriculum, before answering your questions, I would like to provide you some informations.

There's nothing wrong in my speech. When they teach an elephant, they should explain the elephant that they saw. If they can't explain what elephant is like, then they never saw elephant before. Can you understand why I told you you will be the best teacher in Europe if you attend with me for two years' travel together? Because you saw this&hellip; it's possible for you to be the best in the world. My question to him is the same as number one in mathematics (figure #1). It's the starting point. If they don't recognize the number one, they don't know number one hundred. If you collect all the doctors and masters in the same place, they must be silent after my three questions. Maybe they will be silent with my first question&hellip; and I can answer all of their questions. That's the only difference between me and them. That's why I have so hard time like this.

That's why we are traveling every countries in the world. And this time, we are visiting Thailand. So, I would like to listen your opinion. It will be very important part in the political philosophy. About 500 years ago, Japan had a very bad environment for living of people.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*Drinks arrive*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Yes, thank you. This is mailo.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Mm..</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> The Japanese society was divided with various tribes and various powers, and it was very difficult for people to make their living at the time. And for survival in that situation, there were many soldiers at that time. That's why they invaded the neighboring countries and they deprived wealth. But, in the point of 500 years, Japan's society became to be stable. And they continue the stable situation until now from 500 years ago. If you know, please tell me how could this foundation of Japan's society make this? (Do you have any idea about this?)</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P2:</strong> How could the Japanese society&hellip; do you mean the reason for the progress today?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yeah</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P2: </strong>You want the foundation of the Japanese society which has made progress&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes, from 500 years ago&hellip; So far.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P2:</strong> I see&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S: </strong>So&hellip; do you know the reason of the foundation, the basic reason&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P2:</strong> I guess it should be the exploitation of technology, probably, the way that they have put technology to good use. And also, you know, Japan as a society cannot be possible unless it is industrialized. And Japan has to depend entirely on the market economy, because Japan is a small nation, with a bunch of islands, they have hardly any resources, their natural resources are very limited. Therefore they're forced to import raw materials from the rest of the world and convert the raw materials into finished goods, products, and sell them all over the world. That's the only way Japan can survive. And so they're exploiting this and they have also made good use of western technology. And&hellip; I think without the technology and industrialization, Japan would collapse as an economic power.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*After Soyun begins translation, another person comes into the room*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Hello.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> My question is that how that kind of things could happen. What is the basic reason for all those phenomena?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P2:</strong> I think it has much to do with the Japanese character&hellip; Japanese character, their sense of discipline, and loyalty, they are very loyal to the company where they go. And also they've done hard work, and there's the desire to excel, and the desire for excellence. So I think these are certain Japanese characteristics which have also caused them to enlarge to their greatness.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*As Soyun is translating, the clock-tower bell rings to mark the hour*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> All the creatures can be changed by the influence of circumstance and environment. The point of my question is that how their change was possible, and when for their characters. Five hundred years ago, they didn't have any technology and the nation's character was not like that&hellip; and they even couldn't trust each other. They were all divided. This model is the best one when you teach political philosophy. That's why I gave this question to you. Do you want to know about the change in Japanese society?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P2:</strong> I would like to know why you have chosen Japan as a model. Why are we talking about Japan?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Because the model of Japan can be the best philosophy in our reality now. The reason that many of societies have suffering and chaos, and poverty, is that they lack of philosophy and social problems (political problems). That's why I gave the question to you.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P2:</strong> Yeah, but at the same time&hellip; in spite of the great progress Japan has made, can Japan escape the nuclear explosion?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*someone begins to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P2:</strong> Today that is the greatest problem facing all of us. Where is the problem about land if we are going to have a nuclear explosion? I think there will be a nuclear explosion because we all have nuclear weapons, and the purpose is their use. Weapons are for use, not for admiring or for us talking, but the weapons are for use, and while they are there, they'll be used now. And what will be the circumstance if a nuclear explosion or a nuclear holocaust, and in that case what will happen to Japan's progress? Where does it lead to finally?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> When somebody uses the nuclear weapon, then only the area that are attacked by the weapon will be destroyed. I'd like to ask you&hellip; if you meet somebody who is better than you, and when you find some questions that you cannot answer, then will you hostile to him because you think you are insulted? Or, you will be appreciative to him because you have a chance to awaken?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P2: </strong>Of course, I will certainly appreciate this person, there's no reason to be hostile towards the fellow human being&hellip; It's a pleasure to meet another person.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P2:</strong> So it goes what the other person may have, they're very different you from and mine, still then I can learn from the other person many things. And I do not have answers to all the questions.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Okay, then I feel safe, and we can discuss&hellip;&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*some people begin to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If somebody thinks they know something, they should verify about what they know. If you give me questions then I will be able to answer and I can verify as far as I know. In order to know what kind of part we can discuss, I would like to give you a couple of questions before our discussion. People in the past called the universities as the place for truth. Then, what is the meaning of the truth in religion? (Could you answer?)</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*A moment passes*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P2:</strong> I think we could try to ask&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*Tathagata and someone else begin to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1:</strong> This person is teaching the grad students, and she's not only teaching, also helping students, helping serving society. She is a Catholic and part of the Catholic movement.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Ah, Catholic movement?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*After Soyun translates, Tathagata laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P3:</strong> Because, in the world, each of us, they have their own truth. But they have many ways to explain, but actually the truth is only one thing.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Truth is only one thing.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P3:</strong> Yeah. For me as a Christian, where I find truth, whom&hellip; where and whom, is Jesus Christ for me.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Sorry? Where? Speak louder please.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P3:</strong> For me, as a Christian, I know the truth through the way of Jesus.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Jesus. Ah&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> May I mention to your answer? You speak very dangerously. If you believe that truth comes from Jesus, then what kind of teaching that remains of Jesus can be beneficial to human's life?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P3:</strong> This teaching, for me, is not that the other ways are true, but this one is for me. But I believe that in the world, I also respect the other. Maybe they have their own truth, but for me I answer as my soul.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S (after translating for Tathagata, Soyun says something to Tathagata and then says in English): </strong>I'm afraid you didn't understand correctly what he asked&hellip;. He asked that if you believe that the truth comes from Jesus, then what kind of teaching of Jesus&hellip; is helpful for human life?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If somebody asks you, \\\"What is mathematics?\\\" then if you answer that mathematics is God (from God), then it can't be worth anything to somebody who knows what mathematics is. So your answer was just like what I had said before. The second question is that, among the teachings of Jesus, what can you recommend to us to receive for human world? (What teaching could you recommend?)</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P3: </strong>For me, it's the way, the way of love.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> The way of love</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P3: </strong>To love the other as yourself,&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Oh, it's become very interesting. Then, what do you mean by that word love?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P3:</strong> Love is the power, it's guiding&hellip; it's not the word, but it's the feeling it's something concrete, it's something we can touch, it's something that is needed not just to be loved by yourself but love the other. It's something that makes me happy. It's something that makes you know what is the meaning of life, it's love.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T: </strong>All the consequences are created by problems. So when I ask something to you, you should tell me the problem (the question) where does the consequence stay. I gave you two questions, but you gave me two answers without any matters. If you don't have any matters, then you can't verify your truth, and nobody can recognize the truth in the matters. Good teachings always must be in problems. So if my words are wrong then you can tell me what point is wrong.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*after a few moments of silence, everyone begins to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T: </strong>The reason that I always contact universities and religions to research the problem of the human world</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P3:</strong> Of&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S: </strong>The problem of human societies&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P3, P1: </strong>Oh, problem of human societies&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> is that because the main power (the main bodies) of societies are produced from universities, and religion influences very much to the reality of the society.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1: </strong>I can agree to the point that university is the body of knowledge that can solve all the problems of the human society. To me, I think the family, I do agree with her that love is everything. Love can solve all the problems of human beings, because human beings is actually spiritual being. Human beings, you know, it's not like animal, a human being is, we can say, a rational being. Therefore, one thing man can feel is love. In the family, family is where it's possible for the problems, it's the first status in human life. Family&hellip; as a husband, I have to love my wife as family. As a father, I have to love my children &ndash; the way I love, I have to teach them to be good, first. That is the first university in our life, in our human life. That is the truth, then. We can see, we can perceive, at first, okay, next university. The university, yes, will be the body of knowledge that can solve the problem, but it depends on you. In case you choose philosophy or religion, we can help you. If you choose economics, you choose politics, this may be a problem, see? Therefore what we are doing is the philosophy of love, philosophy of truth&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> All the creatures are influenced by environment. If we don't have good society, nobody can guarantee to be happy. When I visited this country before about thirteen or fourteen years before, I met Praya Seong Bon who is the Supreme Patriarch of this country, and he asked me about love. So I answered to him like this. Listen to my answer here, and think about that. \\\"I teach the conscience and justice for people in the world. Because the conscience is the way to brighten our mind and the justice is the way to brighten the society. So if people can live with bright mind in the bright society, then that is the best blessing. So I will act to deliver this blessing to people, and this kind of teaching can apply to any kind of people. And in human society, these teachings can be the best blessing for the human world.\\\" He was very old, but he detained me for 5 hours and he enjoyed very much talking with me.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1:</strong> Can I say about your ideas, about conscience, and also justice, see conscience and justice, yes they will be useful for the humankind and brighten society, but in regards to justice, this also is the problematic word. The word itself signifies something that cannot be agreed upon. The reason for justice, you know&hellip; Iraq's people say they are right. American people say they are right. What is justice according to them? They would define justice in different ways. Therefore, in order to, I would like to mention, the Pope the word, the saying of the present Pope, the present pope say that \\\"There will be no peace without justice.\\\" Justice is necessary for the peace. And no justice without forgiveness</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Without forgiveness</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1: </strong>Forgiveness is necessary, forgiveness is a kind of love. Therefore, if you love, love and justice must go together. Sometimes you cannot just ask for the justice if you don't know how to forgive. Because, we are living together in a society sometimes, we might have done something wrong, something wrong to others because of intentions. But we forgive. Sometimes we have to forgive. And start a new life again, to re-friend each others. Forgiveness, or love, is necessary, as well as justice with the conscience or mindfulness. I think man can love as necessary but not only justice. Haha&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Don't be upset to me because I speak this.

Of course, he can use the word love, but he doesn't understand what kind of matters can accomplish love. So, if I tell you one truth now, then I bet my life. I can meet the Pope, and when I meet him, I can give him 1,000 questions about what he is doing. If he can know what consequences come from his activities, if he can answer 3 answers to my 1,000 questions, then I'll give my life to him.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">*professor 1 begins to laugh*</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> But, it will not happen forever.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1: </strong>I see.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mm&hellip; never happen</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Truth must be verified with the process and if they tell the truth they should verify what are in the results. If we expect good thing then good thing must stay in the result. And the bad thing will come when it comes from the result. You mentioned about Saddam Hussein. Just Saddam Hussein was ignorant, so he couldn't keep his position. And American doesn't have enough wisdom, that's why they can't arrange the chaos there. If I were Saddam Hussein, I would never lost my position.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*professors laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If I were the leader of America, it's very simple to make the society stable. Because, all the answers lies in the questions (in the problems). If we don't recognize the questions (the problems), then we do something wrong always. Do you know why I meet you? Because philosophy can change people's thought, and humankind had influence to make good society or bad society. That's why the most important essence of learning and teaching philosophy is that to know what philosophy is. If people learn or teach philosophy without learning that exactly, it makes problems.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1:</strong> Philosophy, actually, is a kind of answer, you know, that it's possible, to some extent, we cannot &ndash; The task, the task or the duty of philosopher or philosophy teacher is to show the ways to the world. There will be so many ways, so many answers, normally one answer is correct, but so many answers. You may say truth as justice. I may say truth as love. &hellip; Therefore, you may like justice, I may like love. Through love, I can pacify myself and psyche. Through justice, you can pacify the world. Therefore we can say your philosophy is justice as possible answer for you. My philosophy is love, it's a possible answer for me. Therefore, philosophy is only possible answers. It depends on who, it depends on me to choose.&nbsp; I chose love, you chose justice, this is like a food&hellip; I have my coffee, you may like mailo&hellip; mailo&hellip; coffee&hellip; This is philosophy.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> So you say philosophy is the matter of choice</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1:</strong> We can say in one sense,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> One sense</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1:</strong> It depends on interest, my interest,</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> And there are numerous of possibility of answers,</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1:</strong> Yes</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> and ways?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1:</strong> Right&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> But it's not one of correct?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1:</strong> This is a philosophy.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Everything in the world exists by one principle, and here, everything has different phenomena, and it is decided by their own questions (their own problems). I never speak my idea or abstract things. I always answer on the questions by this principle. Whenever you find the point that you disagree, please let me know. The ancient people said the university is the place of the truth. The reason is that because they expected that people can learn philosophy in university. And philosophy stays in every department, and people can make themselves realize by the real philosophy. So please think what people can learn through philosophy you teach now. Several years ago, I visited the secretary room of the Pope in Poland. His office was in ______ [Editor's note: Couldn't understand this or find via search&hellip; @1:14:01] and the office was in the priests' house. Because I listened that there are many priests and nuns who could speak English, so I visited there and I could talk to principal of the dormitory, and she understood very well what I talk. So I asked her, \\\"Did you become to be nun because of poverty?\\\" She said, \\\"No.\\\" In Poland, the Germany people have the Catholic religion, and her family was the Catholic. That's why she became a nun. So I told her my truth, because she seemed a little bit different from the normal people. Because this world exists by such a principle, and same thing always repeats periodically in this world. In this human world, we have the word of the \\\"end\\\" of the world for a long, long time,&nbsp; and this means actually the human world is in very great danger now. So I told her, \\\"People who have religion cannot be saved in the end of the world.\\\" When she listened to me, she said that she wants to live for herself. I told her, \\\"It may be make god a _______ [Editor's note: Couldn't understand this word for certain after multiple listens&hellip;. could be \\\"king\\\" or \\\"kid\\\" or \\\"killed\\\"&hellip; @1:17:50]. No saints (no gods) want the human kind to become miserable.\\\" Right teaching (good teaching) make people awaken spiritually and help them change better. But, wrong teaching harm people who fall into darkness and harm them worse. If religion doesn't depend on the teachings instead they make God stand, then the result is that not for living people but for the dead people. I never interfere with what religious people do. When you recommend people to join or enter the specific religion, then they should reveal first what are in that religion and inform them correctly what is the result of doing that religion and after that, you should give chance of choice for them. But, the current religions don't do like this. Do you know how can I speak very confidently that people who have religion cannot be saved? Everything in this world that exists can exist again by their own activities. If we analyze the human beings, then we can say in two ways. One is physical body, one is spirit. Humans' body is composed by materials, but the main body of spirit is our consciousness, and consciousness is composed by what we have done. So unless are consciousness are awakened spiritually, and if our consciousness don't receive something good, then we cannot expect to solve. I taught people like this, \\\"Religion without teaching is for dead people.\\\" But, if they say, \\\"We have teaching in our religion.\\\" then they must reveal their teaching is beneficial for human world or not. If a mathematical teacher teaches mathematics without questions, it makes new problems. In current religions, I cannot find any religion that they have teaching that result good result. I can perceive everything in the world. So if you have something to know, please give me your questions. Then I could answer. If you want to know very concretely, then you should ask me very concrete way again and again until you understand. Otherwise, even though you listen to me, you don't have perfect understanding. If I don't have this ability, how can I visit all the intellectuals in the world and I request talking and 'give me your questions' alone (I am alone.) ?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*P1 and P3 begin to laugh a little*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*a short moment passes*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P3: </strong>I just want to say, I am a teacher, but I am not teaching in philosophy or religion.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> So you are not teacher?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P3:</strong> In philosophy or religion, but I am teacher.

It's not like before in Eastern philosophy of China, they teach how to become human being. They told me I must ask my spirit 'What are human being?' They say they don't know. Their body &ndash; they just know they have a body of a human, they do not know they have also soul &ndash; spirit. Now we recognize that we cannot all of that. Finally, we try to teach the student about our ethics, or morals, or the ground of the Thai country, or various religions for the graduate students all over Thailand now.

If you know my truths of myself, then you will be very surprised. About 60-70 years ago, Korea was the colony, and I was born in colonial society. My parents lived in very remoted place and I&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*the clock-tower bells begin to ring to mark the hour*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">grew up with the juice of roots and plants, and my misery was that when I was one years old, my father passed away, and they didn't leave anything for me, and my mother had the responsibility to brought me. And we had to survive, that's why my mother every day went out for work, left me alone in the empty house. When I became 9 years old, my mother passed away. So I never had any others' assistance, and I've never been educated by others. But, I am confident that my knowledge is better than all the knowledge of all the doctors in this world. Every intellectuals have to silent if I ask them three questions consciously. But, actually, they will be silent to my first question. And I will answer to their questions exactly the correct answer according to the principle and the problem.

He said that his major is social philosophy including political philosophy. That's why I mentioned about Japanese philosophy and Japanese history. Because this topic is very, very important for the educator in this age. Because there are so many poor countries in this world and there are so many people who are suffered from starvations. The cause of their suffering comes from the individual ignorance and wrong politics. I had the same topics like this in India many years ago. When I visited New Delhi, the capital city in India, I had invitation from the Vice Chancellor of Nehru University. His name was Dr. Agwani (the president) and his first question was that, \\\"Could you tell me the future of India?\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1:</strong> The future</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mm.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong>&nbsp; So I told him, \\\"Unless the consciousness of Indians change, then the problems of India will be continued.\\\" Then he asked to me, \\\"Then the person like you live in Korea, then why your country has such problems?\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">\\\"In this world, there are so many ignorant people. So, Korea's same. In Korea, there are also so many ignorant people. That's why they create all the problems.\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*professors laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T (laughing):</strong> \\\"Then, how are you received by Korean people?\\\" So I answered that, \\\"Oh, I am not well received even my wife.\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*Tathagata and professors laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> When I listened to my this question, he became more polite. He said, \\\"I believe that you are honest people.\\\" So, whenever I visit India, we had time to meet and talk.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">We also traveled Pune. Pune is the city of education. We had invitation from the vice chancellor of Pune University. When the president met us, he gave me this question. \\\"Could you tell me where my soul is?\\\" I answered, \\\"Before I tell you the answer, I would like to confirm could you understand what I speak or not.\\\" He was a very famous philosopher in India, his name is Mr. Gupte.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1:</strong> Mm, Gupte, yes&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> So, before I give the answer to his question, I asked him this, \\\"Where did a bean pea come from?\\\" This question seems very easy, but answers are different depends on individual.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">He answered to this, \\\"Is it right that bean from bean?\\\" When I listened his question, then I decided that I could answer to his question. \\\"That's right. A bean came from a bean. But, suppose if I ask to bean tree, 'Where did you come from?' Then the bean tree answer, 'I came from the soil (the ground).' So people can't answer in a different way from their different view. Your soul stays inside you, and your soul will bear the fruit by what you have done. The bean sprout the bud, and the bud grow up, it open flowers and bear fruit. And the fruit become a seed and it sprouts again and grow up new plant.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*professors sound impressed*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> So your soul is made (is grown) by what are inside you and when you die, you will revive through your soul. Good yourself or bad yourself will be made by what are in you.\\\" When he listened to my answer, he was very impressed.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">\\\"Many people around me are trying to know this, but nobody could explain like you.\\\" So he said, \\\"I have very good time to understand myself.\\\" And he organized a meeting with the professors and he introduced the new president after his retirement.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*professors laugh quietly*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> The important thing is that education must produce the human's purity. So I never say, \\\"You do something bad.\\\" If you do something wrong, or if you think something wrong, the reason is that you've learned like that. That's why teaching is very important. I never say to any kind of religious people that what you do is right or wrong (I don't mention like that). Because the best way is that they should realize by themselves. So if somebody tell them, 'Oh, you are not right.' then they hurt. I'd like to tell you what I've seen. The result that you believed in God, believed in Jesus, is that only you receive Holy Spirit. But the only problem is that you don't know exactly what is the true nature who are the Holy Spirit (who is the Holy Spirit). So it will be very hard to recover you without depart the Holy Spirit inside you. But, if you keep the Holy Spirit inside you, then it will influence to your decision. That's the problem. If you could have met us earlier then you could do something great for yourself and others. In Christianity, if I ask them, \\\"Who is God?\\\" they say, \\\"It is Creator.\\\" But, the Creator never contact human society. No matter how hard you pray to it, it never influence to human life.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*professors laugh quietly and then P1 says something I couldn't understand*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> You should know this fact. Any kind of consciousness find it impossible to contact the Creator. That's true, Jesus Christ was a good teacher. But I am <em>very</em> sorry for this fact that the Christianity doesn't have the teaching of Christ. This is the misery of the real Christian (of the real true Christians). If you more devote for that religion then you will have more chance to become servant of the dead spirits. So I don't tell you that's the great thing or not. But, you kill your own soul for the dead spirits.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*professors laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Of course, the ministers or fathers can have assistance of the dead spirits from their activities. That's why they can enjoy their lives very easily without doing some hard work. But they must pay very much. If you are true Christian, you should seek for the real Jesus' teaching. But it will be difficult for your ability to find out what was real Jesus' teaching.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P3: </strong>Yes it true that before that, just seeker. Everyone also seeker. Every day I try to seek and try to listen to the Holy Spirit, and then every day I try to tell myself, like this 'You are nothing. You are everything. I'm nothing. You are everything.' and that's why for me, how I see you, God? How I can see you, Jesus? And I cannot see you. But I can see him through people, through moon, through sun, they also my brother and sister. Sometime it's more difficult. But then I have experience. And experience is the most vital thing. That&hellip; for me. I read Bible, I read many book about religion, but that's only knowledge. But for me to have the experience is invaluable in life. Together with conscience, this one is, I think, I will be very experienced. I experience and then the other thing, that comes</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> You want experience&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P3:</strong> This one is very beneficial by the evidence from also make me, how you say&hellip; that I really exist because of my experience. Not just only knowledge outside and I'm living, my action is inside my mind.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> You already have the Holy Spirit in you, but the Holy Spirit doesn't seem to give you very bad influence. But in some cases, it can influence you badly. It's useless for us to depend on our thinking without knowing the fact. Prayer can give us consolation, but it can't solve the problems in our reality. You see, there are two lands, one is occupied by farmer, one is occupied by minister of church, then the result of harvest is better of the farmers. No matter how hard you plead to God or Jesus, \\\"Please farm our land\\\", it's useless. If people want to have good harvest, they need to know the way of cultivation and what are in the process of farming.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">You are learning, so you probably can understand what I say even a little bit, and you may probably understand me even a little because you've experienced many. When you listen to me, my words seems abstract, but when I listen to you, then I feel quite stuffy. I feel stuffy because when you speak something, then you don't have any certain matter. And the reason that you can't receive my words as they really are is that you cannot recognize the questions in what I speak, and this difference between you and me cannot be overcome easily.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">I can give you everything that you need. How about you? Do you have wish to be a Christ for Thailand people? Then I give you all of my wisdom. This is a worthy dream that anyone can have once. If you can find anybody who is superior to my wisdom then you can take my life.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">If you devoted for a long time as a Christian, then first of all, I would like to tell you about what did Jesus want to do. Don't think that Jesus was the son of God in abstract way. Jesus was a kind of teacher who was hardly met in human world. If you really want to do something for Jesus, then you should make him as the real teacher for human life. That's the real mission of the Christians.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">Are you interested in me? If you are interested in me, then you can ask the questions that you really wanted to know. If you find time to meet me (to visit me), then please if we make an appointment you can visit me, but when you come to me, you bring your ______ [2:08:48] tape. It's impossible for anybody to understand what I say after one time of listening. But, if they try to check in the reality what they've heard from the tape, then you will be able to recognize and understand what you didn't know so far. I understand how this world work with principle. Because I speak like this, please don't think me as a strange person. The things in the world repeat again and again periodically. The end of the world means one world move to next world, and at this moment, this world leaves something it must throw away. So, temporarily, all the creatures and all the civilizations will disappear. The prophets foretold this phenomenon as the end of the world. It's up to you whether you will be able to save yourself or not, and we can know immediately when the end of the world come when we calculate what happens in this world. Everything acts repeatedly like the hands of the clock.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1</strong>: I have a meeting&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>Satto: </strong>Okay. Thank you.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*Soyun translates for Tathagata*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T (in English):</strong> Okay.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*P1 leaves*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> The time of period have just arrived one minute to 12, and the hands of this watch will arrive to zero, and everything in the world will return to original phenomena. If we calculate this in the world time, we left only 14 years.*&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S (interpreting for Tathagata): </strong>You may be wondering how he knows this.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P1: </strong>This is for him.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>Satto: </strong>Okay. Thank you.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Because everything in the world is predestined. If somebody knows the principle he can answer to <em>any</em> part in human world such as politics, science, religion, economics <span style=\\\"font:12px Helvetica\\\">&ndash;</span> <em>all</em> of the parts. So I can talk about any part and my talking will be not wrong in the result. When I see that human beings do, I feel very stuffy because if they want to find something, they need to invite somebody who know that. So, no matter how long time they discuss, but if members, all of them, they don't know, then it's just waste time &ndash; they can't find the way at all. You are good person, but you wasted many hours (long time). From now on, you'd better that you become the Christ instead only believe in Christ. It is the way to save yourself and help others. So if somebody asks you some questions, then you just say, \\\"I don't know\\\" when you don't know. That's the best answer.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*a few moments pass*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P3: </strong>Thank you very much. I appreciate the talk, because though your talk is different for me, it's not make me, how you say, waste time. The difference between us is the gift of knowledge. Not just give knowledge but for life.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I never speak my own thoughts. I only speak when I see the result that produced by the questions, and all my words are true. That's why I can speak about all the teachings and I can perceive very easily any kind of the world. This moment you met me will be the best memory in your life. So don't ignore this moment that you had the best academic career but you had to listen to a man who didn't even graduate the primary school.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*Tathagata and P3 laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> But you need to know this fact. The real genius is born from oneself.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> He's not educated by others.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Even though you learn for ten thousand years from human beings, then you can't be over (beyond) the level of human beings.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P3:</strong> I agree. But we are indebted to beyond because I believe, in religion, all wisdom of all things that you receive maybe from the world, from above the world. Like the monks in Thailand when they live in the forest to cultivate the divine. I mean you get it in the world like that. There's some people who have wisdom. Then many indebted come to listen to them for teaching like that, about wisdom for the world. I agree about educated people because they have knowledge without indebted people like in the forest. But how come they have the wisdom from beyond? Many people came to receive the wisdom&hellip; because they received something from beyond &ndash; from divine. I cannot that God, or the divine give them, but \\\"grace\\\".</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> That's not true&hellip; Even though they have the highest academic career, but they are still ignorant. That's why they are deceived by them. It's like the same that you could receive the other spirit (Holy Spirit) through your praying. But, the monks could receive the dead spirits through practicing meditation. When they receive the dead spirits, they become to speak very fluently even though they don't know what they speak. But, because people don't recognize what the question or problem is, that's why they are easily deceived by their words.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">For one month in Thailand, I've met so many monks but I've never found anyone who could tell me one truth. So actually, the monks, ministers, priests, are worse than you. When you observe their reality, we find that they had some problem to cope with their social life so they escaped to religion. If, for example, their nature is apple, and they plant to religious soil, they can't change themselves to mango. All the seeds revive their origin finally. In the same principle, if somebody becomes religious person, it doesn't mean the stupid people change to excellent one.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">One benefit to become religious people is that they always preach something for people, but if they have some problem in their speech, then if they can't take responsibility about what they spoke, then they only use the Buddha if they are monk, or Jesus if they're Christian.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*after a moment*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Did you understand what I said...?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P3</strong>: Yes</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> So, it's very easy for people to be deceived by them. They don't doubt about what they speak. Before you become to be a Buddha or to be a Jesus by yourself, some being you expect doesn't appear in front of you. So you know, when Jesus was enlightened and he started to save people, then he seemed nothing at the time. When he was killed, who was beside him? Maria Magdalena was a kind of prostitute, and only his mother, Maria. Besides of two women, who stood with him? Yes, he had some disciples, but when he was in danger, they ran away.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*Tathagata laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> And among the disciples who are in very high position in society at the time. So, religion only uses the name of Jesus. If the Christianity really have Jesus' real teaching, then Christianity can't expand like this. The place that have good teaching, the Holy Spirits or ghost don't enter. If the ghosts don't work, then people don't come, people don't donate. Gautama Buddha was Enlightened perfectly, but he didn't enjoy his life well. He had to beg for survival. He had to walk when he traveled.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*the clock-tower bell rings to mark the hour*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> This is the proof very few people stay with good person. There can be many, many people and people always attend something _________ [Editor's note: Couldn't confirm understood. Maybe \\\"dead _____\\\" @2:33:33]. So I hope today our meeting will be a good lesson for your life. I will die before the end of this world come but I live for 10 years. Do you allow that I become your friend during I'm living in this planet?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P3:</strong> Yes do you have a website or something?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> No&hellip; email?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Email?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*movement occurs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> I will give you the address.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S: </strong>He will give his email number.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>*Satto exchanges emails with the professor*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>Satto: </strong>Do you mind to give me your email?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> To become my friend, you need to know exactly who I am. If you have me as a real friend, you will have eternal life. But, if you want to die forever, you shouldn't make me as a friend. This is a very clear fact. I don't know how to speak English or I don't know how to send email, but if you send email to me, my people in office inform to me.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:13px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P3:</strong> This is great, because I always observe it's better to have friends&hellip; Because I believe that each one of us should have attention to himself, we should have attention to some people in society.

I'm looking to find out about a couple of things. One of them is &ndash; I'm curious to find out about death. I'd like to find out about the process&hellip; what happens?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Soyun (interpreter for Master Tathagata): </strong>After death?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Well, death itself. The activity of the body stops. What happens?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Master Tathagata:</strong> At the moment our body stops to act we feel very, very comfortable. After for a while, our soul comes out from our body.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*After a few minutes during which someone is typing*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Four kinds of phenomena appear when people die.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> So we feel comfortable and then the activity of the body ceases, or the activity of the body ceases &ndash; stops &ndash; and our soul stays and feels comfortable, is that&hellip; which one? Or both?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Even though the soul stays in the body, stopped all the activities&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> The body stopped, yeah ?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> But the soul feels very, very comfortable. It feels like we are free from all the burden.&nbsp; But the soul doesn't realize it's dead. One phenomenon is that when people die then the soul feels like they fall into the very, very deep sleeping, and they forget everything. In that situation, the soul is reborn very quickly. And the next phenomenon is like the situation that they sleep very, very peacefully. And the fourth is to reach to Heaven. They preserve their consciousness in the excellent comfortable situation. But one phenomenon that I mentioned that they feel comfortable, they feel like they let down all the burdens, but they don't feel they're dead. In this case, they find it difficult to be reborn.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*After a few minutes during which another conversation takes place&hellip;*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q: </strong>So, what are the four phenomena? The first one: get comfortable, feel sleepy, and then, the soul goes to sleep, and he's reborn, rapidly, you said. Then, the second one, they lie back, let go of all their burdens,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto (sound engineer):</strong> Sorry?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q: </strong>There were four things,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> The second one, I didn't understand</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q: </strong>Yeah that's what I'm trying to clarify&hellip;. The second one, let go of their burdens, lie back, feel sleepy, let go, but then don't think that they're dead. So I'm guessing that's where the whole ghosts business comes around. And then, the fourth one, their consciousness remains intact and they go to Heaven. But what's the third one? I missed one.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto: </strong>Ask again&hellip; explain again.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata and Soyun are speaking*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Soyun (interpreting for Tathagata):</strong> First, there are four ways after death, right. The first dimension is that they die, even though they're still in the dead body, they feel they're very comfortable, like let down all the burdens, but they don't feel they died, so that's why they feel they fall into deep sleep. Then they're easy to reincarnate &ndash; they can be reborn.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Mhm</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> But the second&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Which takes, how long, generally? Is that a quick process, or it can take a long time?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> It depends on their Karma. In this case, they can be reborn, anyway.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Mhm, okay. Anyway.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> But the third, is that they go to the eternal life. They feel that they are in very comfortable sleeping and then they go to eternal life. And, he explained that, they also feel very, very comfortable condition, very comfortable like extremely nice dream. But they still have their own consciousness.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> They are aware.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah. Their own consciousness. Then they can go to the Heaven.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> And the fourth?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> They are four. One is they can be caught by the world of grudge, of the ghost. Then second, they can reborn (reincarnate). Third, is eternal life dimension, and the Heaven. When they are very, very pure, then they can go to Paradise.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> So what's the difference between Heaven and Paradise?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Heaven still belongs to this Earth</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> It's connected</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> But Paradise is completely different, this is completely free from these three dimensions.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Oh okay, so Heaven and Paradise are not connected.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Connected &ndash; different dimensions. But according to Master, Heaven itself is not so high dimension. This is the middle level between the supreme dimension, to this Earth. So, people say Heaven, but Heaven is not so high. Even in Heaven, there are some bad plots because the gods in Heaven also are influenced by the gods here.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Hm, interesting.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> In the second dimension.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Sorry, this is the second dimension?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes. The ghosts' dimension is first, then the human beings' dimension is second.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q: </strong>Then what, Heaven third, and Paradise fourth, I take it.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mm, eternal life.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Ah, okay.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> So, Paradise is really, really good place. All the Buddhas stay there and even some Bodhisattvas, even though they didn't reach the Perfect Enlightenment, they also can go when they have power to stop the activities of their Karma, it is possible to reach the Paradise.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto: </strong>So any Enlightened Beings go directly to the fourth dimension.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes, fourth dimension.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> So, it's been written I guess, or been said, that before you die, your life flashes before your eyes, you see your whole life. Is that not the case?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> No, because we didn't heard from the person who experienced that. Master never mentioned about that. Master doesn't answer before he sees that, or he meet the person who experience that by themselves. At least we need to hear from them.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> What about the Creator?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Creator.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Who, or what, is the Creator?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> According to Master's teaching, the Creator is 100% pure energy. Buddha still has mercy and love for people but the Creator doesn't have even mercy or love. So this is perfect pure consciousness only.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> So what's the Creator's relationship to the world of origin?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> It only created the law (principle) and everything is created by the principle. So, Creator didn't create any butterflies or elephants or&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q: </strong>So what, the creator is the foundation?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mm, foundation. So, we can say that it only created (made) the law&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> The conditions</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes, and everything evolved upon the law.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Mhm, okay&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> So, the law means it is the law of repetition.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Yeah. Well that pretty much answers my question. So the Creator really doesn't have a relationship with humans.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> No, no, never. Even Buddha doesn't have relationship with it.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> With the Creator.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mhm. It is absolutely independent.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> It's a force.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah. So it is the real core of the universe. It stays in the center of the universe. So even the highest gods can't approach that.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Aha&hellip; Well, there we go.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Master still doesn't know the secret of Creation. If someone knows the law of creation, they also create things.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Mm, I see.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Even Buddha can't create even a small plant</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> We say, \\\"manifest\\\"&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Manifest.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> M-A-N-I-F-E-S-T.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Manifest. Manifest a plant</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Ah, okay. Well if that's the case, many people are wrong about many things. Okay.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> We've heard that in Oxford every year they have a meeting to debate about Creationism and evolutionism.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto: </strong>Where?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> In Oxford</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Oh.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> City. So we</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Every year?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah. We were very interested in</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> To attend</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> in attend there. For Tathagata, it is so simple to speak about that. But they have debated long, long years.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> So then how do human beings actually come to exist, if we weren't created by the Creator, or the force that we refer to as the Creator?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> If he want to find that, he must go back long, long way&hellip; million years.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> So human beings have been around for a while, then&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> If you ask those questions to others, then it's like I want to tell a lie &ndash; I want to listen to a lie. Nobody can answer.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Not even Tathagata&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Even Tathagata, if he has to know that, he must go to million years ago&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Back&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Back&hellip; mm. So it's useless.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Hah&hellip;.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Too far away.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Sorry?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Too far, hehe&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Guess it doesn't really matter, does it ?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Hm&hellip;. It doesn't matter. The best wisdom for ordinary people is to know fact.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Hm&hellip;.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Because Socrates spoke that sentence, \\\"Know yourself.\\\" That's why Master admits that he was a Saint and a great philosopher.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Ah! That's the last question I wanted to know! What about people who commit suicide?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Mm&hellip; even though they commit suicide, they can't free from their action because they have another Karma that they committed suicide &ndash; they killed self.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> So&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> So, even though it kill the body, they didn't kill their soul. That's why only the Karma put on their consciousness</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> More&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> though &ndash; More.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> A bigger debt</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> To beat the Karma, they kill themselves. So when they're reborn, they commit those things again.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> So the Japanese have got it wrong, then ?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> That's why only stupid things. Even though they kill their body, they can't touch their soul, only their behavior put in their soul.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> I don't know if the Japanese wants&ndash; because it's not because they hate, it's because they have a kind of&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Oh, it's a ritualistic thing, I understand that, but suicide is suicide, if that's the case&hellip;&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Even though they stay in the world of ghosts, they are deeply suffered from their behavior. They will fall in the world of grudge, maybe they will stay in the dimension of ghosts.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Mhm&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> So it make them very, very miserable for long, long time.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*some time passes*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> I might have more questions, but I'll send them to the Hotmail&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Ask, if you&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q: </strong>No, no, it's&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto: </strong>She heard many things.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Yeah, no, no, no, it's not that, Satto, it's just what I've heard sort of stuffed me up a little bit. So I need to rework a couple of concepts.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Ah, that's a question. Of the four possibilities, what determines which outcome occurs?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Outcome of?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Of the four, is it something&hellip; well, I'm gonna state the obvious I guess. I take it as the way of the life that you live. Is it as simple as the life that you live leading up to your death determines which of the four things occur, or is it something else?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> I don't understand&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Um, say for example, I live my whole life as a murdering, rapist thief.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Hehe okay&hellip;&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Right? Because I've spent my life being a murderer-rapist-thief, does that mean that I'll be&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> According to their Karma, if they have heavier Karma, then it's</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Then it's more likely</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah, it means they have more ignorance, and attachment, greed, grudge, then they can't reincarnate.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> So it's more probable they'll be ghosts</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes. It's very simple principle. In this world, everything that is light floats higher, and heavy just comes down. So, if their karma is heavier then it will come down, so their karma is very light, then they go up. Same reason.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Okay. Now, so if we die, and we don't become a ghost, and we don't be reborn, and we go to heaven, then, are we reborn again or is it only if we choose, or do we have to be reborn periodically?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> So&hellip; Why Buddha taught very much for people was because the last thing you obtain through your life is grudge. And when you have grudge, then your mind entangled by them, and when you die, your mind can't scatter. So you keep your mind even though you die, and mind works.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata speaks to Soyun*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> But if you're reborn, they must repeat the life cycle according to their karma. Even though they don't want to be unhappy, but they can't, they are not free from their karma. But the third dimension, eternal life, we are free and we can decide our own destiny.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> So we don't have&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> If I want to be born as a king, I can be, if I want to be born as a very poor man, then I can choose that destiny.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> And if you don't want to at all?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>But nothing forever&hellip; even some soul go to paradise, they can stay there several thousand years, but they have to come back again.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q: </strong>They have to?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes. Because in paradise there's nothing to accumulate virtue more because everything is good. No evil.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Right.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> So that's why they come back here again to accumulate virtue.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Heh. So it's not that the virtue diminishes?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes. So they become the owner of their destiny.&nbsp; They are free from Karma. Still they have Karma, but they can control themselves.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Q:</strong> Mm..</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> So they obtained freedom. Only they can stay in that dimension for several hundred years.&nbsp;</p> <p/> <p>&nbsp;</p></div> </div>\";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<div class=post> <div class=post_header> <h3>Meeting Buddhist monks in Thailand</h3> </div> <div class=post_body><p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Tathagata:</strong> We came to Thailand to contact living Buddhism.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Buddhist monk, Doctor:</strong> Living Buddhism?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Soyun (translator for Tathagata):</strong> Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>However, we haven't yet contacted that living Buddhism in this country. Before leaving Thailand, we came to Chiang Mai as last time. I hope to find the living Buddhism through you.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Monk and Soyun begin to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I still don't know if Thailand Buddhism is for living people or for the dead.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Monk begins to laugh quietly*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> (For whom)</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*a moment passes*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Could you answer?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B:</strong> Um&hellip; I think the situation of Buddhism in Thailand right now is for the people.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> For the people</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B:</strong> Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Living people</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B:</strong> Yes&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Then could you tell me the proof that you said before? (You said the Thailand Buddhism is for the living people, then could you tell me the proof of your claim?)</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B:</strong> Still people&hellip; come to monastery, study Buddhism, but not as a whole, okay? Practice meditation, there are many, many meditation center which is going on running and quite popular, you see, and it's evidence&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah&hellip; that's your evidence.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>In the village, in each village, there's one temple and it's the center for the religion. Whatever functions, ceremonies, some people are close to the monks, to monastery&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>If somebody say this is the living Buddhism, then they should have the ways in their teachings. For one month, I have been looking very hard in this country to find the Buddhism with the ways, but I failed to find anyone who knows. And now, I am very surprised to listen to you. Do you mind if I speak to you my truth (the fact)?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>No I don't mind.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>People teach meditation and people learn meditation. Then what is the reason of the activities? Is the reason of compassion or the reason of ignorance?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Meditation?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yeah, meditation. Why do you learn or teach meditation? Because people are ignorant or people are so generous? What is the reason: compassion, or ignorance?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>It should be a right thing&hellip; to learn meditations. We, you know, actually we develop only science. We develop very high in science and technologies. People forget to develop their mind &ndash; themselves. So in our society these days, as we evidence, it's imbalanced. People rich, at once, in science and technology, we develop, we live in comfort with the basic needs, but some people not happy, right? Many people having mental problems, many people live in the state of fear, worry. Depressive pill, maybe sleeping pill follow for these people because imbalance developing. So meditation, it make them to understand themselves too. Not for compassion only, but to understand themselves. To live &ndash; to know how to live.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>To know</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S, B: </strong>how to live</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>happily</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>happily</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Not&ndash;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Because, she has to translate many&hellip; if it's too long&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Ah&hellip; too long&hellip; hehe..</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Soyun translates for Tathagata*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>If you try for meditation because of compassion then your compassion is much higher than the Buddha's (Gautama Buddha's). But if you learn or teach meditation because of ignorance, then this is really miserable thing. I have wondering always and doubt when I see the people who practice meditation. When people practice meditation, they find themselves become peaceful. The reason is that in the process of practicing meditation, the dead people's soul can enter to their bodies. In this case, they feel they become very peaceful. The creature can be divided into two kinds. One is body and the other one is a soul. If we compare to some material, the body is like a car, and our soul controls our body and they make their own activities through our body. So, if the others' soul (the dead soul) come into our body, it means that we have two drivers in one body. If the invader&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>It means another person's soul</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>push away original soul and it take the handle, then in this case, own body (original body) don't conscious anything. (Even though they're hungry, they don't feel much hunger. They don't feel tired.) It means that they don't have peace from meditation. On contrary, they lost themselves. In some case, there are many other souls can invade. In this case we can see many kinds of activities (behavior), many different natures, from the one person because there are multiple souls inside. Then it is so unhappy thing for a person, and meditation is the best way to call the dead soul into one's body, and the dead people always try to attack the living people. So this is for the dead, not for living people.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>This means meditation, he said</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Once when you contact the dead soul or let them come inside, nobody can expel them again easily. So, in my point of view, this is very dangerous. (Meditating is very dangerous.) That's why I always questioned why do they practice meditation as this is so dangerous, because of your ignorance, or because of your compassion? Today we visited a TV station (Chiang Mai TV station) and asked the director introduced, \\\"If we meet you, may we can have right answer from you.\\\" In Bangkok, when I stayed there, I proposed this idea&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (interpreting):</strong> Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>I proposed this idea in front of many monks and many journalists: If there is one person in Thailand who understands the real Buddha's teaching, know even one thing of Buddha's teaching, then I would like to donate 10 million baht for them. I would like to spend this money in Chiang Mai city.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata and Soyun begin to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (interpreting for Tathagata):</strong> Do you think, is it possible in Chiang Mai?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*All begin to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>This is not a matter of money. This is very, very important thing for numerous living people. This is the only opportunity that you can check what have you learned so far and what you have teaching (taught and are now teaching) for people. (You can check the truth of this.) So, it's very simple for me to verify that's Buddha's teaching, that's not Buddha's teaching when I listen. Because Gautama Buddha always told like this, the cause makes result. (Cause produce effect.)</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Oh, cause.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Cause, yeah?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Buddha told like this. It means that there was a way (there was the ways) in his teaching. So when we speak about the truth, or speak truth, then we should show what are in the result by problems. So I have been wondering indeed, who can show that to me?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Show?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Show that. *Soyun confirms with Tathagata*</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Show Buddha's teaching ('that' Buddha's teaching) to me</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Some begin to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Thailand has much more monks (number) than any other countries. So it will be very miserable thing if so many men become monk only for giving their body to dead people and sacrifice themselves.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (explaining):</strong> If their purpose is like this, it is misery for them.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Even if our soul stay in ourselves, but if those souls don't act (can't act) then they become useless. So I am very frightened because you believe that the practice is good and you also want to spread them to ordinary people, society. But if you really want to spread this, you should tell others what is the result, what can happen in the process of meditation. Then they will decide. (They listen all the result and they will decide.) So you just give them the opportunity to decide whether they will practice or not. (And the full realization&hellip; the truth of this) I don't make any comment about their decision. If they want that, 'oh, I sacrifice my body to the dead soul', that's okay, because that's their freedom. But it's not right for some people who deceive others like this, 'if you practice this then you will get healthy or you can have peace'&hellip; If people cheat like that, this is not right. When people learn living teaching, they just can understand when they learn one day. (They understand whatever they learn in case they learn living teaching.) But, people will ignorant if they learn dead teaching. (If we go 100 years, they are in the same state of unknowing.) The result when they learn dead teaching is that if somebody has very intelligent and healthy consciousness, he will recognize he has been cheated for whole life. So, if you do very well, finally you will learn one thing. Finally you will find that 'even though I have been trying to learn for all my life, I couldn't know any one thing'. I would like to have a bet with Buddhist scholars, teachers, and Buddhists in this city in Thailand, about Buddha's teaching. I would like to use your Buddha scriptures and we would like to have an opportunity to confirm through the question and answers. And the condition of this game is that I am only person, so&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (interpreting):</strong> He will give 100 questions to you,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>and your team, we don't know how many people you will have (the scholars monks or ordinary Buddhists&hellip;), you will give 100 questions to me. If I don't realize (don't understand) what are in those questions, if 1 question&ndash;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (interpreting):</strong> You gave him 100 questions but if he's wrong in only 1 question among 100 questions, then he will be a loser. Or, if you can know even 1 answer of his 100 questions,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>then I'm also loser.&nbsp; (If you find only 1 answer.) I like perfection. So if I lose in this game, I will donate 10 million baht. If I bet 10 million baht, then you also must bet a little money (I don't want much). At least 1,000 baht.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>So he will bet 10 million, you will bet 1,000 only&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>In fact, if I win, but that money is not enough for our hotel rooms.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*All begin to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>But, it will make a very good motivation to happen to you (good thing). I'm staying in Chiang Mai three days more. So, please help me, and please give me some opportunity to meet good teachers in this city. And if you really try for this, then you will learn much more things within three days than through all your life. If you learn from somebody who doesn't know, then you will not know even though you learn for 100 years, you are in the same state of ignorance. But if you learn from somebody who knows, then even though you learn a moment, but you know. You will realize this simple truth.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*a brief side conversation takes place*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>I hope that there will be much good things in your future, and I came here to see you because I want you'll be a person who saved Thailand Buddhism. In case you can make up your mind with your friends (maybe, people around you), to revive the lost Buddhism, then I want to help you. I will awake your sleeping soul and I'll let the dead souls away from you who have been cheating you for a long time. You can't attain anything (you can't accomplish anything) with the dead souls inside. But I admit that you live in peace. Because if you work that the dead souls enter the ordinary people's body, then ordinary people will support your living. You have your own appearance but nobody knows your actions come from your own soul or the others. The result is that you will give a very dreadful result to the world. So this is not simply the matter of compassion. These days, there are numerous dead souls who are trying and want to stay with the living people because they led their livings in wrong way when they alived, and we should solve these problems by right teachings. It's very difficult without your effort and your sacrifice to make this world good. So, from now on, if you have some questions or you want to know, then let me know. I told you before I will answer all the questions from the excellent scholars, then you can test me right now, how can I speak like that. And if you have some questions in the sutras, or any other books you've read or learned, then right now, you can ask me if you wanted to get answer.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*a moment passes*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>If you trust me, you can know the things that other people never could understand with their own lives. Otherwise, maybe we can go together, to the forest to meet the forest monks&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Forest monks?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>&hellip; and what kind of practice do they have and what is the result of their practice, we can have opportunity to check. I will show you no one, you may believe that they know something of Buddha's teaching, know anything of Buddha's teaching. When you confirm this fact your action can be different. Of course, in your position, my words is the last thing that you want to believe. But when you have chance to check and confirm you may can be different. It is impossible to compete to me with the power of the dead souls and the gods, ghosts. So it is impossible for them with their power to deceive me. You will be able to see the true color (true nature) of them with me (beside me). So&hellip; could you recommend one name in Chiang Mai who is the best teacher?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>The best knowledgable monk</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Best knowledge&hellip; There are many. Um&hellip; There's one close to here. He's master of meditation.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (laughing quietly):</strong> Master of meditation&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Mhm.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Shall we go to him together? You may see some evidence he may lost himself already and he could show very strange behavior in front of us. I can see what his soul is like (how his soul changed) only when I meet him, I can see that. So the best way to learn is to confirm. When we check everything can be revealed &ndash; is meditation really good for ordinary people, or not. When people practice meditation, there's something wrong happens, then the dead soul possess the living person, then the living person show the activities from the dead soul. From that time, the dead souls try to tell others that meditation is the best way for you because they want another dead souls that enter the body. And the result is that it becomes spread like infectious disease. In this case, without any check (confirmation) of the fact, then this becomes very popular and the population become increase very rapidly. You act now very reasonably, but if we have chance to have interview with the monk that you recommended then he will show us a very unstable attitude.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Would you like to go to see that master - to meet him?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Mm&hellip; Yeah.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*a moment passes after Soyun translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Let's go together.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> It's far from here?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Ah&hellip; 3 kilometers maybe.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>3 kilometers&hellip; not so far. That's near&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>The important thing is that many people has great expectation upon you. So you are important one. So you need to see the fact and you need to realize the truth. And this chance cannot be given easily. If you don't see by yourself, with your own eyes, you will not believe&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>maybe he go but however he report to you what happened, but if you don't believe that, you don't believe it&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>In this world, we hardly have good people because there was no good teachings. If you wish I can help you to open your eyes to what happened in the world. There's no more virtue than you teach what you saw and know. (So if you teach what you know from your own observation, then that's the best virtue.) But, you can make mistakes when you try to teach something without knowing. Please let me know if you found something that you can't agree with me. Then I show the evidence of my words and we'll go together. If there's no proof how we trust something? I can see what is in the truth but you cannot see. In this case, without clear evidence, how we can trust? That's why the proof is most important when you explain something what is between us. When you check by yourself the result of the long time of practicing meditation, then you can teach people around you. You shouldn't try much to give your body to others' soul with compassion. Buddha left the path (ways) in his teaching. But eventually, the dead souls interfere religions. Because they interfere (have been interring a long time in religion), that's why we lost the ways. So I can tell you if you read Buddhist sutras more and more, harder and harder, then it will cause more damage. Buddha's teaching are not stay in Buddha's scriptures only. We can see Buddha's teaching in <em>everything</em> in this world. So I can teach people how they can see those things in the world. Because I don't know your purpose to became a monk I can't tell you all my truth before you tell me your truth. (What is your aim to became monk or stay as a monk?) No matter how hard you try to teach something for people but the fact is that you don't know. So the result is not virtue but sin. Even though you want to learn this world, but you don't have any teacher who can tell you. So that's also in vain&hellip;. I'm staying in Chiang Mai for three days, so try to learn the world, to see the world. Then you will be the best monk in Thailand in the future.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Where are you staying?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>We are staying in a hotel, People's Place, it's just opposite of Chiang Mai Holiday.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Holiday villa.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Chiang Mai Holiday hotel is very new but we are staying in a small hotel&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Monk and Soyun laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>I can donate 10 million baht for good thing but I am very, very stingy for myself. So I sleep in the room of 450 baht&hellip; *Soyun laughs* a night&hellip;. This is my nature (my true nature) to show for people. My nature is that so stingy for myself but generous for others.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Buddhist monk speaks to someone in Thai*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Are you visiting here for three days?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes, three days here&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>When we know what life is, life is so precious because there is a way in life. The way which you will survive or not in the future stays in life, and the decision you will be a Buddha or a devil stays in the way in life. So what I'm so anxious is that you don't see these ways. Because when we tried in Bangkok, some people said, 'Yeah, in Thailand, there are many monks who know Buddha's teaching' so we spent several tens of thousand baht in this country now.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Mm&hellip;. What is the real meaning of Buddha's teachings?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>When I say Buddha's teaching, it means teaching for the living people and the living teaching can awake people's ignorance. But modern universities and religion, they don't do this thing properly. That's why the human societies are in very dangerous crises. Otherwise, why a person like me appear in this world? This world left a very short lifetime. If you decide to go to the Buddha's way even though it is very difficult, then I can do for you first to save your life. But if you stay in this situation continuously, then your soul will meet the end. The only way to avoid the end stays in the truth, and we should see the way in the truth through only problems. But it's impossible for you with your abilities now to see them.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*a moment passes*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>I will check to that monastery whether the master is there or not. If he's there, we'll move&hellip;&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>To that monastery.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>That's a good idea.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>How many years have you been monk?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>I have been monk for 2 years.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>2 years</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Don't think life carelessly. Life is not such easy thing. You should check always what you're doing. There's no teacher who can teach you among monks. So, you'd better to check this fact with me using this opportunity. If we go to meditation master, then I tell him what is the problem with meditation. Then he will say, \\\"No, you are wrong. Meditation is good.\\\" Then he must show the evidence of his claim. It's very dangerous for people if they can't show the evidences of their claim (they teach that).</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>I want to ask a question&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes ?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>You mentioned about meditation.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>But you think that it's dangerous ?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>I don't know what kind of meditation that's dangerous. Please comment&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>You've already infectious&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Did you understand what I mean? &hellip; \\\"You have already infectious\\\" Ah, it means that there is an infectious disease spreading but you also have infection. \\\"You are infected.\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>It's very easy for dead soul can invade (enter) to your body through you practicing meditation. In this case, there are two drivers in one car. So, two souls try to control your body. According to the cases, if the invader (the others' soul) don't make your own soul act then your own soul will become die because of lacking of energy of activity. Everything in this world can bear fruit from their activities (what happened in their activities). When they stop to act, it's impossible to bear fruit. As the result, one's own soul will die because they don't act.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>If we stop acting, nothing moving, right?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Mm&hellip; nothing moving</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>&hellip;or what?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Have you seen water&hellip; it doesn't move&hellip; water doesn't move, then they decay?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>There is a hole, water, no flow, it doesn't move,</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Water?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Then they go bad. Have you seen that? This is just a phenomenon when water doesn't move, it just becomes too bad.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Everything in the world is fixed.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Ah&hellip; we wait for car,</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>How did you come here?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Ah, we came here by taxi</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> By taxi&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Ah, taxi. So&hellip; car has gone out, maybe another few minutes&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Good, excellent&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Do you want, I'll get you coffee, &hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T (in English):</strong> Coffee !</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes, please.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Maybe a few minutes, and I'll come back. I have a meeting with a monk, he may accompany us&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yeah</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> But stay with us&hellip;&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Yes, I'll stay here, back with your coffee&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Good&hellip;&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> He'll come too?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yeah he will come back. He'll attend a meeting&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*a few moments pass*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>So&hellip; yeah?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Buddhist monk 2:</strong> So how long have you studied Buddhism?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>I've studied in this life. I just see them. That's why among my words, there's no untruth. But I know one thing. The abilities of the gods can't compete to me.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> The gods?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yeah, gods. No competition with me.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> Oh&hellip; he doesn't believe in&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> He mistakes god with&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>No, there are many high level of gods, but&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (interpreting):</strong> their wisdom can't be compared (compete) to him.&nbsp; No competition with&hellip;&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> He means&hellip; uses his theory to prove truth by himself</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> Without the ability of gods?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>No&hellip; he just opened his eyes, just see the truth, and tell what he sees. So he never studied from books &ndash; he never read any other books.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> Then&hellip; where does the knowledge come from? From his experience?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>How can somebody see everything in the world through their own experience?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> Ah&hellip; what?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>How can someone see <em>everything</em> in the world through their own experience? Because you asked him \\\"from experience?\\\"&nbsp; So he answered like that. With experience, nobody can explain everything in this world.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Because I am not so rich, so I bet only 10 million baht, if I am rich man, then I could bet 1 million million baht. You know, if I make one mistake, one word, then it means I lose 10 million baht. But it's not easy to take my money.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Satto, Soyun, the monk, and Tathagata laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>So, I came to Thailand and I challenge the game, this is you know, one of ten thousand times.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Somebody arrives with drinks*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Would you give me a glass of water?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Monk:</strong> A glass of water? Okay.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>It was really interesting&hellip; We visited Mahachulalongkorn Buddhist University in Bangkok, same branch&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> Yes, it is the campus&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yeah, campus</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>And we saw a western man gave a lecture to many monks. He made speech about Dharma. So after his lecture, then we talked to him.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*side conversation takes place*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>\\\"You spoke very fluently to the lecturers&hellip;\\\" So he said \\\"I was very impressed by what you told. I'm just wondering did you talk what you know or you don't know? (Did you talk what you know or did you talk what you don't know?)\\\"&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> He talk a lot&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*monk and Soyun begin to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:&nbsp;</strong> So, you is not you &ndash; the lecturer.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> Ah&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> The lecturer, the western lecturer,</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> Oh, he asked him that,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yeah, he is speaking about story (what happened). So&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>\\\"To check about that, if you spoke to people what you know, or don't know, so I'd like to ask you 100 questions from your book. If you can answer one question, then you are winner. \\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Monk:</strong> Glass of water&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Thank you very much</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>\\\"If you cannot verify through your answer that you know one thing then you will be a loser.\\\" So, I bet 10 million baht for this game, and he (the western man) asked me, \\\"Why are you trying to lose?\\\"&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*monk laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>So I answered, \\\"If you can beat me, I'll be very happy. This is a game (bet), so I bet 10 million, you bet 1000, okay?\\\" So, on the conversation, a monk came, and he took the western man. So, I lost only one opportunity to make money of 1000 baht. *Soyun laughs* Thailand people maybe don't like gambling, so I can't find anyone to lose 1000 baht for me. Aren't you wondering how I can make this big talk? In mathematics, if somebody don't know figure 1, then they don't know 100. When I see the book, I can find this is from somebody who knows or somebody who doesn't know. So no matter how he may insist (claim) that, \\\"I know\\\", but if I demand the evidences (the proof) of his knowledge, then everybody will be defeated. You may have some opportunities to listen the visitor lecturer and so what you've learned are all the word &ndash; they put their own word together. That's why actually your knowledge, you don't have much knowledge that can be helpful to people actually&hellip;.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*a few moments pass*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>So&hellip; did you have some questions? When you study?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> When you study?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Mm, when you study Buddhism, then do you have some questions that you cannot have answer?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> Um&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Some doubts&hellip; or questions&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> In Buddhism?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> What you learned, yes&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>In Buddhism, in life, or about yourself&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Something you don't understand&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*a moment passes*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> I just learn and practice and I don't think anything easily without proving. I just practice according to the Buddha eventually but I never looking down on others' knowledge. I always honor other things. I am aware of the moment, to learn, but you talking about belief, or you follow honors, he should want make this issue to follow&hellip; but however, when we stay in the world, when I am living, I try to use my bad action and try to cultivate good things.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Okay&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> Not only for me for others</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>You have very noble idea but your dream cannot come true easily. It is possible for you, what you just wanted, when you make yourself realize after right learning. But I am concerned about you because you don't have any teacher to make you realize around you. You think you learn but the content you learn everyday is just listening to something that is made by people. But those teachings doesn't make your soul brighten. Instead, it makes your soul go to a more dark place. This age is very dangerous.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> Dangerous</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Dangerous</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Dangerous&hellip; this age</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> Dangerous</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Dangerous, yeah</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>If we make a little mistake, we are entrapped (fall into a trap). So it's not good for people to practice meditation carelessly as they want to have peace. Such play is a very dangerous gambling. (It will cause great danger.)&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> Um&hellip;. Personally, I think that meditation is nothing &ndash; is the way to calm down the mind because in Buddhism, we believe that every human's actions started from the mind first. Life consists of two parts. Mind and body. The mind is the master: whatever he thinks from the mind first&hellip; So the body is just a slave of the mind. The body just follow from the nature. One day when you die, you have to return the body to the nature. You have only the mind&hellip; good or bad according to your action, right?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Okay, let's listen to the master about what you said.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>He is different, he says,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>I don't have thinking. I don't think,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>He is perfectly truthful person and he only conscious of things, he doesn't use his mind.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>I explained before about meditation continuously, and we are going to meditation master to check this.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> Yes&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>You can get calmness in mind or peaceful because you don't know how the result (situation) happen . That's why you just have belief that meditation is very good for people &ndash; because you don't know the process how people have calmness in mind. When others' soul enter to our body, it's very easy they can make such kind of phenomena. You may want to deny this fact&hellip;. but that's not right for you to deny without any confirmation. If you listen to others very easily, then you also may accept some others' soul. I've already perceived a certain power that is moving in your inside. At the moment, I can't tell you what kind of influence it will give you. But I will be able to tell you when we have more time to contact and how the activities of that soul influence to you.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*a few moments pass*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> He's from Japan&hellip; right?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Mm&hellip; he is not Japanese. He was born in Korea, South Korea, but we came from England.&nbsp; Yes.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> Mm&hellip; What is the purpose to meet&hellip; Just travel around?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>No we came to Thailand to contact the real Buddhism.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> I see&hellip; You can contact Buddhism but if you don't practice, you're not the truth at all. You just contact&hellip; like he say, just learn from effects, just learn from the person, but you don't practice&hellip; Find some opportunities to practice and you'll realize the truth. The reason religion is practical is not by coming into contact, it's not by this&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>We don't know when you say practice what do you mean by that? If you want to know the truth, then you need to meet a teacher who knows that. That's the best way to learn if you want truth. Otherwise, this is just the matter of hope &ndash; it can't come true. The Buddhist monks have been cheating people for a long, long time by those words. And there are so many monks who spend their lives in vain because they are cheated by those instructions. I am very anxious of them, not because they just spend their lives in vain, but because so many people live without realization themselves (they forgetting themselves) because they are controlled by the dead souls. Buddha devoted himself for living people, not for the dead. It's true if we awake the living people, then we don't have the very miserable souls.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>It means that when they live rightly, when they stay in the living situation, but they don't become miserable ghosts.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>According to Buddha's teaching, this world is not decided by people's hope, but all the results will come by the causes of what happens in everything. He only revealed this truth.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*a few moments pass*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata says something in Korean*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Car&hellip; How is the car ?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> It's coming&hellip; hehe.

No car?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> No car&hellip; yet.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> Are you hurried to go somewhere?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>ah, no, not so hurried, but&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata says something and Soyun laughs*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>He says,</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Just the master can speak English?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> Uh&hellip;. I'm not sure if the master can speak English, but we can have a translator translating him&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Mm, he can translate.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Go to the doctor, and let's go now. We can take a taxi.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B2:</strong> Taxi?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S, Satto:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> We can</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>We will pay</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>We will pay, no problem.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>We don't know when car will return&hellip;</p> <hr/> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>The meeting with master of meditation in Chiang Mai, Thailand</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Soyun (interpreter): </strong>Hello</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Monk:</strong> Hello, good morning. How are you?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Monk:</strong> You can sit on floor.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Uh, yes..?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Maybe he will prefer to sit on a chair.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Should I sit here, or</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>can he sit in a chair?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*movement occurs and some time passes*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> He will sit here, I think</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>You sit here?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Okay&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*more movement occurs as people get seated*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Today I visit you because I have one question that I cannot have answer. I came to Thailand and I've met many of monks here, and they told me meditation is the best teaching of them. So I have lots of things to understand about this.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*a monk begins to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>When I was very anxious about this subject, that young man asked me, \\\"Because the monks are ignorant, that's why they practice meditation. Is this right?\\\" So I answered him, \\\"No, you're not right. Probably monks practice meditation because they have great compassion.\\\" So, we came here to understand what is right of two claims. And he asked me, \\\"What happens with us when we practice meditation?\\\" \\\"Everybody has different nature of organs.\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Monk:</strong> &hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Organs&hellip; according to individual condition&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>\\\"But the common thing is that they have same result.\\\" And he asked me again, \\\"What is the common result that happens to everybody?\\\" I answered, \\\"When people practice meditation, they receive the dead soul (the soul of the dead people) inside and when this happens, such a person have to live without realize oneself.\\\" And he asked me again, \\\"How it can be compassion?\\\" \\\"The dead soul always demands (always needs) the body of the living person. They can express their intention (what they want) only through living body. So, when people practice meditation the result is that they give their own body to the dead people. So it is impossible for anyone to practice this without great compassion (mercy). In Thailand, there are several tens of thousands, maybe several hundred of thousand, monks here. I don't believe they do this (they practice this) because they don't know anything about this. So, I'm sure they practice meditation because of their mercy, and they think that compassion is the best teaching. The best way is that we go there and confirm.\\\" So, now we are sitting here.

But, you are doing what the ordinary people never can do.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>M (via B):</strong> Insight meditation only personal meditation. It doesn't matter that you know everybody, but if you don't know yourself, not very big. The great benefit that Buddha taught is see yourself, to understand yourself.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>So, what did you come know about yourself? (What do you know about you?

If somebody practices meditation as they know the secret of meditation, has great mercy (or compassion). But if somebody practices meditation because they don't know the secret of it, then they are ignorant. Because of their ignorance, they practice meditation. So, could you understand why I speak like this?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>M (via B):</strong> You should ask the meditator what they practice and then what they will get from the practice. You should not judge or criticize by your thought without putting your thought to practice first.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata laughs, and then some monks laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (interpreting for Tathagata):</strong> As he saw you, so he's already known everything what could you get from your meditation.

Otherwise, I shouldn't come here.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>This subject is very important for people in this world. Do you know? If it is not so important, we shouldn't come here. We've lots of expenses. We came from England.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Do you mind if I speak the truth (the fact) here? Do you mind if I speak to you what I've seen?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B (interpreting for meditation master):</strong> He doesn't mind</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>It's okay</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Okay. Life has two things: body, and consciousness. Our body is nothing more than a tool (instrument), and consciousness does something that it needs by using this tool (the body).</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>M (via bikkhu):</strong> In Buddhism, these things were taught for long time since the Buddha's time until now's days.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>So he agrees about this?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Yes he agrees about this.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>But, when you practice meditations, then dead soul can come into body.

In Buddhism, we have different ideas, from this, we don't believe in soul, we don't believe in spirit, okay? But we believe in the mind. The mind can be practiced, and could be good, and could be bad, according to your practice. But he only criticize himself, he don't accept anything!</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> But sorry, but, he's speaking with him.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Hm?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> He wants speak with him.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Right, right&hellip;&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Not your opinion.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Okay&hellip; The same idea.

I cannot accept yours.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>No. Everything in this world is fixed, and every answers is fixed. And the answers are made by the questions. So you are a monk, and you became monk, maybe many years ago, and if the monks don't know the cause make the result, then they are not real monk.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>M (via B):</strong> Many, many ideas formulated until now, just now only one idea. Many, many views.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>All the facts can be revealed when we check. If you think that what I speak is wrong, then do you agree that we check together? (We confirm)</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*after B translates for M, bukkhuni speaks to M and then bukkhuni begins to laugh*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>M (via B):</strong> In Buddhist idea, training or practicing mediation, Buddhist view about meditation, is a personal experience.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Yes&hellip; you should have told us before. But it will be a crime (sin) if you don't tell others about the result of meditation before you teach them others.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>So you think this is&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>\\\"It will be sin of you if you don't tell the result of training of meditation when you recommend to others\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>M (in English): </strong>Simple example&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B (translating for M): </strong>The monk say that when you arrive in Thailand, when you are hungry, okay, you find the restaurant to eat to solve your hunger. You passed the buyer, and buyer never asks you where are you from or whatever, but he will sell the food to you. Meditation also you just come and practice first before questions. Okay? Hard practice, and then you can question as the result.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>This young man asked me, \\\"What will happen if I practice meditation?\\\" So I answered, &ndash;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*M begins to speak*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B (interpreting for M):</strong> The monk, he says that we don't know the result of the others people doing meditating but he only know himself.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Only himself&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Yeah, only himself.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Not any other person&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>B: </strong>Not any other person, but any other person, they practice, they will know themselves also and then when they have some questions, they can come and ask monk and get the answer.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>Some people who give questions to you are ignorant, so they don't know the world.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S (interpreting for Tathagata):</strong> But he can see this world.

If you saw that situation, you would probably stand on their side. In your view, he is very great. But I am not like that. I am nothing. If you can record our talking in case I meet him, then when you listen again, something that happens will be very funny. Because they are the Buddhist monks, I would ask them about Buddha's teaching. But you'll find in the recording that they don't realize anything about Buddha's teaching. There is a difference between Buddha's teaching and any other teaching of Saints. The difference is that Buddha teaches very clearly about the relations between causes and effects. All the ways exist in the problems. It is not Buddha's teaching if it doesn't teach what causes lead what result in what problems. All the effects are made by the causes, so the problems in the causes are the ways to create the results. Even though all the Buddhas who had appeared in the world discussed with me, then they can't be superior to me. Then who there can discuss with me about the truth? In the present, I'm wondering the world with very poor conditions, so nobody recognizes me. But the things I left through my living will be the best teaching for humankind. After my death, all the religions in this world will disappear. And, the hypocrites will try to make me their idol of religion again. That's why I'll record this very clearly. It is not so helpful to you to serve me. Instead, you should learn hard and awake yourself to obtain the way to find good self. I never want that I become a Buddha or idols after I die.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Dominic:</strong> But it will probably happen anyway...</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Yes, it will happen. It will go ten thousand years that they make me as idol. It will be the most honorable thing for you that you see things through this travel. It will be the best experience and most honorable thing through all your life. Before this travel, I nearly thought that I'd travel alone because Satto told me he couldn't come and Soyun also had some problem. But Satto is very lucky. It doesn't matter whether you feel or not what do you obtain through this traveling. But this is a real fact that you joined this travel. And also it is true that you will try to let people know my meaning that I want to leave hope for mankind. And all the results lie in these two facts. The Catholic pope always sells God but he doesn't know anything about the almighty God. Satto's mother told me in their religion they don't believe in reincarnation. So I told her it's not right to deny things that exist. If you plant a bean, it sprouts. It opens flowers, and it will bear fruits. And after bearing fruit, then the bean tree will die. The bean sprouts again and opens flowers and bears fruit again. We call it transmigration. Everything makes and revives what was in 'motae' (the origin). We call the activities as transmigration. We can see transmigration through everything. So it's not important for people to accept or not. It's more ridiculous that they don't admit this fact.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> But things like one stone can't make a fruit.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> No, it also changes. It takes a long, long time. It changes to a small stone, then sand, then it changes to soil. And it can be a stone again. About water, every animal drinks water, but this world keeps the same quantity of water. It transforms a little bit in some processes. It evaporates, becomes clouds, and rains, and is water again. This modern society is very convenient to confirm everything by using some systems. But people tend not to admit and accept something exists because people lost much of themselves. If people meet me and they can understand how the world works and exists, then it's very easy for them to find the way to save themselves. And they can have hope. The reason that all the people tend to avoid me is that they forget themselves. So it's meaningless for me whether people receive me warmly or not. I'm just trying to tell them to give hope in this age so I explain what exists, how they exist.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">Monday we will probably go to Chulalongkorn University, virtually the best school in this country. We will meet the principal of the university and ask him, \\\"Do you know some truthful people around you?\\\" It's ridiculous that very high monks refuse without any confirmation when they listen that Buddha comes.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D: </strong>Not really&hellip;. It's ridiculous, yes, but understandable.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> What I do in London is just like this every day. So in this country, maybe I'll invite some high monks and give them teaching. I'm not sure when our travel plan will change because this is just wandering. If I can have a chance to have a meeting with the intelligent people or high monks then I can wait for them, maybe I can stay in Bangkok for one month. If I have a chance to have questions and give answers with such persons then I can wait here for one month or more. If they ask me, \\\"Are you really a Tathagata?\\\" then I'll ask them, \\\"Do I look like a crazy man?\\\" I continue such difficult, hard traveling for 20 years. But nobody treats me to one bottle of water because I do this work.&nbsp;Then, why should I do this? Am I crazy?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D</strong><strong>:</strong> Good question. If all your days are like today, I would have quit many years ago. One year or two years, ok, finish&hellip; find another hobby...</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I have too much of trials and tests for this work. If I were not a Tathagata, how could I grow such a bright personality in spite of such terrible trials? Despite I never received any education, but I grew up very bright and purer than any other people. The Korean government knows this fact about me.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Soyun (interpreter):</strong> Ask him about your interest. If you don't speak, he won't know.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>D</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;No, no&hellip; I've got questions, but not today.

In order to obtain more accurate information, we have been traveling around the world.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> We have a principle that we can find more accurate truth than any other scientists.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> And we make very close examination on the matters by this principle.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> We have very few mistakes&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> of our information.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> We have reported about a variety of fields but we haven't had such many mistakes on our report.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Yes, yes&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> We are hoping that our information and knowledge will be very contributive for humankind. Even if we observe the same thing, but according to our vision (because of difference of vision), we can see on the different way.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Mhm</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>At the moment I cannot confirm that how our information will be helpful to you, because of this problem. In case you're interested in what I speak and try to confirm what I speak, then my information will be very helpful to your study. We know that recently the environmental problems have become a very great issue in society. But we still don't have the correct knowledge about correct cause that it occurs (the environmental problems) by scientists. Some claims from the scientifical world are quite distant from the fact itself. I'm very worried about these aspects, what's going on now in society. I am, for example, like a mathematician. I always see the matters by applying a principle. That's why it's possible for me to discuss any matters. What is your specialty? I would like to talk to you with your specialty.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Okay. Well, let me first ask a question about your concern about climate change. What concerns do you have?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>What I am most concerned is that the temperature inside of this Earth is increasing now. And today's circumstance has been predicted several thousand years ago. And the cause of the increasing temperature on the surface of this Earth is that crack in the gravity field. When the crack occurs in the gravity field, things inside of the Earth start to act. And the temperature is increasing on the surface of this Earth because of some activities inside of Earth.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Down below</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yeah</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Okay</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I believe that you have scientists here study about gravity. In fact, they are totally ignorant about the real substance of the gravity. How does gravity act to ecosystem on this Earth, and the role on ecosystem. Nobody knows how the gravity was formed. When the gravity was formed, how could it keep (preserve) itself continuously? Fourth, nobody can even imagine how the crack could happen in the gravity field (by what kind of circumstance). The crack of the gravity field caused from the breaking of balance in the ecosystem. Of course, the real cause of this circumstance is the modern civilization. Nobody can stop this (nobody can prevent). You may understand because you are the scientist ________ [Transcription note: Couldn't make out this word @13:05] to Earth science. This Earth is the mother (Motae, origin) of all the living things. This Earth, like the living creature,</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Mhm</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> shows response (reaction) to any change. Because of the crack of the gravity field, in core, the core of this Earth start its act. I've heard that (I would like to confirm from you), this university is the first one that created the nuclear bomb?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto: </strong>Some scientists from here</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Soyun (interpreter for Tathagata): </strong>Maybe some scientists made the nuclear bomb in this university for the first time, is it right?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> No, I think the nuclear weapon was built at Los Alamos.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>Satto:</strong> Yeah&hellip; but some scientists from this university, maybe&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Well, you have to read the history of atomic science&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> So, no?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Hm?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>It's not true?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> No, I think you have&ndash; it's&hellip; who was involved is&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> From this university</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G: </strong>is well documented and I'm not aware of the details. It happened a long time ago.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> I see <strong>*translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> The nuclear&hellip; when they start to act, then it increases with tremendous speed. Now, we say we have 1&deg; Celsius</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> I don't know about Fahrenheit</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Mm, yes that's right</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Yes, we use celsius</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> 1&deg; C increase. But it doesn't make such serious problem. But, if the degree (temperature) go to 3&deg; of change, then the Earth is ready to exploded. In order to help your understanding, I would like to explain one example. We have energy in our body.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Mhm</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Energy has the same role of gravity on Earth.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Mhm</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Our energy in our body play as the role of the immunity. If the energy becomes weaker, then we have problems in the immune system. It's very easy for human body to get the disease. Somebody is very serious if their body temperature goes up, and where our normal temperature is maybe 36.5, 36, but their temperature increase 39, until, then it becomes very dangerous. This is just like our body system. When the energy in our body cannot circulate well, then the immunity power becomes weaker. Like this, this Earth has same system just like our body. At the moment, mankind faces a very, very serious condition now. But nobody really wants to know the truth of this circumstance. And this society is _______ [@19:50] by the very abstract rumors and claims by the idealists. Many people who concern about the environment, they always claim something, but their higher voice is not helpful to solve this problem (environmentalists). When the crack of gravity occurs, the first symptom is the temperature increasing on this Earth. Secondly, air temperature on the surface of this Earth will increase. Earthquake and volcanos will follow. All the civilization will be swept (will be disappeared) by crustal movement. You may know well, we have numerous amount of waters on this Earth. When there is the crustal change (movement) on this Earth, then we expect <em>very</em> big tide, maybe 1000 meters of high (big tide) and when we have this tidal, then all the civilization in cities will be swept. What will happen later? Then we need a system and we should apply the principle to the system, then we will observe very simply. What human beings should do now, how they can save this human society when this catastrophe is over (is gone)? Actually the most serious thing in this circumstance, so many people just show hypothesis and theory, but nobody really wants to know the solution of this problem. They always claim something on the theory and hypothesis. I still don't know what do I know, what do I don't know. However, when I see the problem, I can see 'what is' in the problem. Then I find what is the answer and solution of the problem. This Earth has saved itself continuously by using what is in it (the problem in it). Recently, I found very frightening things during my study about the history of humankind. It was the secret that how this Earth could preserve itself for endless ages. This Earth works repeatedly (endlessly) by using what are in itself. This discovery was very, very helpful to me to solve the riddle of the Earth. I am studying about the future world (future generation) after this generation. No matter how superior I may, or I have very excellent view, but it's impossible for me to contribute for humankind alone. That's why I keep my traveling. The purpose of my traveling is looking for somebody who loves themselves. I started this travel more than 20 years ago. I haven't found anyone who really wants to learn why they have to live and what is in their lives. How can I talk to them about the world even they are not interested in their life itself (even themselves)? I still don't give even 1% of my knowledge to mankind.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata laughs quietly*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*a moment passes*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G: </strong>Well those are very interesting points of view. And I think the, from my own point of view, I think the science of climate change is robust, in terms of the cause of atmospheric temperature rise. But it's tied to the physics of the atmosphere and substances that we've introduced into the atmosphere, for example by combusting fossil fuel&hellip;. The physics of radiative transfer, from space to the Earth's surface, are robustly known. And what we're seeing is entirely consistent with human emissions of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, in terms of forming. It would be interesting, I understand that this is a different point of view than the crack in gravity, and pointing this out raises another hypothesis that Earth scientists or physicists would want to explore&hellip; But I think right now we have the view that is making sense.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata laughs quietly while Soyun is translating to him*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>These days, as you said, scientists found the cause of global warming from the greenhouse gas. It's okay, we can make sense from the theory. If global warming is caused by greenhouse gas, then we already have so serious unbalance in ecosystem now.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G: </strong>Well, I think the imbalance in the ecosystem is also human induced, and science&hellip; and humanity needs to address these imbalances. I'm in&ndash; I'm totally in agreement. We're using up the carrying capacity of the planet. &ndash; Which is what he's saying, in terms of the Earth needs to be in balance&hellip; But this is something that we can do, rather than resign ourselves to catastrophe.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>As I told you, the activities of core of this Earth has already started. That's why no human beings can stop the activities of inner of this Earth. This Earth is run by perfect science. For example when you already work (touch) a bomb (explosive)</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Like dynamite</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>then how can you make it stop to be exploded? Things in the world has been determined; that's why nobody can change the decision.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G: </strong>I need to bring this to a close, if possible&hellip; because I must go back to my work. I do appreciate your visit, and I do appreciate listening to the points of view, and&hellip; I'll talk to other Earth scientists about the detection of disturbances of gravity. And, that's an interesting point of view, and if measurement of gravity fields allow us to detect such changes, then that's an important result. So I do appreciate your visit, and your time with me&hellip;.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>What did you say about measurement of gravity? &hellip; The scientist is measuring gravity field?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> So, did they found any change in the field?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Uh, as far as I know, they can measure the change of the mass of Greenland and infer the amount &ndash; the fact &ndash; that Greenland is losing 15 cm of water per year. That's the accuracy with which they can measure gravity.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata replies and Soyun speaks with him briefly*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Okay, only one thing more&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Yep</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>No doctors the modern medicine could check the energy in our body. (Modern medicine cannot check.) And gravity is a force (power) and this power becomes the origin of all the living creatures. This is the real cause that all the ecosystem to exist. &ndash;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>G:</strong> Yeah&hellip; yeah&hellip; Okay. Well, thank you.

In America, people never held philosophers in great respect. They always think it's very strange if you are a philosopher.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Ah haha&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Most people I meet refuse to believe I am philosopher. I meet a guy in a bar or skiing, and he says, \\\"What do you do?\\\" and I say, \\\"I am philosopher\\\" they don't believe me. I go to a party and I asked people once at a party in San Francisco, \\\"What do you think I do for a living?\\\" and they said, \\\"Well, you must be in sales.\\\" Or some guy said, \\\"You must be a lawyer. Or maybe you're in advertising.\\\" Nobody ever says \\\"you are philosopher.\\\"</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> I see</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> So I don't think there's any change in America. It's always the same.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Soyun translates*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Americans think you are slightly crazy to be a philosopher because they think you don't make much money. But they are wrong. I make a lot of money.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Do you know somebody in America who knows the definition of philosophy?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Oh yes. In any dictionary. You can find it on&hellip; the web. You can find it on the Internet. Philosophy.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I've never read any definition of philosophy in web, Internet, or dictionary.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well I'll give it to you right now. Always have morphology. Morphology. God loves morphology. 'Philo-' means wisdom. So &ndash; sorry, 'philo-' means love. 'Sophia' means wisdom. 'Philosophia' is love of wisdom.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Ah&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>*Tathagata laughs briefly*</strong></p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Such definition is not clear.

I haven't met anyone who could tell me definition of love</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Oh really?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> when I ask them.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Ah. Why do you want a definition?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> The purpose of learning is to know.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> If we cannot know from learning, it's better for us not to learn.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Why? Because, you see, why do you want definitions? Definitions only tell you the meaning of words.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Because the term love contains very, very important meaning.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Yeah</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Only when we know what love is,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Yeah</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> we can live properly as human beings.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Really</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> What do you think of how many people can understand (can answer) this question?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> I don't know. But it doesn't matter. The important thing about knowing what love is is to be able to practice it, not to define it. The word is not what matters, it's the practice.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Hehe&hellip; If we don't know the meaning, it's impossible for us to practice it.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Oh, it's very easy to practice it. I practice it for years.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Haha. Without learning, how we can practice?&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Well, let me give you another example.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Hm?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> For centuries, we didn't know the meaning of life. Of what it is to be alive. But we still practice life. It wasn't until the 1950s that we began to get a scientific definition of the concept of life. So what? We still know how to live.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>If somebody doesn't know the meaning of love,&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Yeah</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>then we cannot say he or she really live.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> No, you're just wrong. I can tell you I have a dog who loves me, and he doesn't know the meaning of love because he's not interested in words. I'll bring him here, you can see it. And I love him, too. He's a good dog.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Yeah</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>You say you love dog and your dog loves you,</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>then please tell us exactly the meaning that you say that love.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Yeah, it's, the meaning is the relationship that I have with my dog, and a whole lot of other things. I love Cabernet Sauvignon. Some people&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>You mean love is relationship?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> There are some</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>S: </strong>Between&hellip;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> There are some loving relationships. So is hate. Hate is also a relationship.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>T: </strong>But love and affection are different.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Yes. Yes, indeed.

It's very, very important for people to know and answer what is the definition of philosophy. In order to tell the definition of philosophy, first of all people need to know what is the origin of philosophy.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Still not sure I got the question right, um&hellip;Uh, okay. Um. You're asking about how we teach philosophy here? Or about the philosophy of life in general. Um I'm not sure, you know, what's the question.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>D (while S is translating):</strong> I think what she's asking &ndash; what's &ndash; are you asking about the actual history of philosophy itself? Like, Ancient Greece and Socrates and Plato and Aristotle&hellip;?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> In this case, the question is too wide. Like mathematics, I just point out what the question is (what problem is).</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> So his question is very, very concentrated and simple.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> You are very lucky today. Because you never thought about this case.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P:</strong> No, I, I don't understand your question. That's it. I don't think I understand what you're trying to ask me. Because she said you wanted to, you know, learn more about modern education, or see the future through modern education, so I, as a teacher here am assuming that you will be asking me questions concerning our educational system, but you are asking me something about, you know, my personal belief in philosophy. And I'm not sure, you know, what it is that you would like to know.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I ask you about the world of philosophy that you know. I might give answer to you if you ask me what you want to know or what you don't know. In the past, the universities were helpful to the society because there was philosophy in the universities. But nowadays, the education of university become go bad (transformed) because the philosophy in university lost.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P:</strong> It is not here, we still do teach &ndash;&nbsp;we have a very active program of philosophy here.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I visited so many universities around the world. In Oxford University, there are 250 professors in philosophy. No one amongst them is willing to meet me. They already know what is my question to them. You teach philosophy here but you teach them without understanding what the origin of philosophy is. And this is a very important thing.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>D (aside): </strong>You should just ask what is the origin of philosophy&hellip; I'm curious now.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> When people learn philosophy properly, then people can accomplish to complete themselves (self-perfection). But if people learned the philosophy inappropriately then people will lose themselves.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Are you a professor in philosophy?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I am the great philosopher.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Oh</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>D:</strong> And modest</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Nobody could answer to my questions up till now. If you want, then I'd like to have a meeting with some staffs here once.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Mmkay.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>Sato:</strong> It would be very, very interesting.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> It's very difficult to understand the world of philosophy in short time. But if you record what I say then when you listen them again then you will recognize at least what is philosophy. The philosophy is that to reveal the problems (what is made by what causes).&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Mmkay, um, excuse me, let me interrupt you a little bit. First of all, I still don't quite know why you are here, okay? And um you've introduced yourselves to me as, I don't know what it is, but um, yes, you are from um the Society of Natural Science, and um, and I don't know what it is, but you're here with a great philosopher to ask me certain questions about philosophy, and um, I don't know what the purpose of your visit is, okay? And I have kind of a little feeling, you know, that I'm getting a little confused here. Okay. Maybe I'm not as great a philosopher, but I don't know why you're here.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>D:</strong> Confusion's par for the course.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> I'll answer</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P:</strong> It's okay</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> to what you said.</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Uh huh</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>T:</strong> Thailand is country of Buddhism.

She's also an expert in Buddhism, maybe she'll be able to answer your questions, you know?</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>S:</strong> Alright</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"margin:0;font:15px Helvetica\\\"><strong>P:</strong> Because I really don't know why you're here.

(they speak very carelessly what they don't know) <p/> Soyun (interpreter): (they don't know but they speak carelessly) <p/> T: this is the way to accumulate bad karma. Because the bikkhu (your teacher) didn't give me any questions -- <p/> S: Ah -- <p/> T: He gave us kindness, that's why I didn't give questions to him. Even though I ask him ten thousand questions, they can't answer even one right answer. Instead if he asks to me ten thousand questions then I can answer to him 100% right. In this world we have one principle. Everything exists (everything in this world is) by this principle. When you learn Buddha's teaching properly you can understand (you can see) this principle. Because the monks in this country don't know this principle that's why I understand that you don't learn properly Buddha's teaching. <p/> M: What is your principle? I would like to know about the principle. <p/> T: The principle means something is decided (fixed). For example, in mathematics five plus five makes ten. This is the principle of this mathematics. In this world, according to the problems, good thing, bad thing happen. You haven't learned properly about this. When you learn this thing properly you can obtain good yourself. <p/> M: How can I learn the principle? <p/> T: It's very simple. First, you should meet the enlightened master. Listen to the enlightened master and you should check what is (what you've heard from the master -- you should check in the reality). </div> </div>\";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<div class=post> <div class=post_header> <h3>At a university's international affairs office in Asia</h3> </div> <div class=post_body><p>Soyun (Interpreter for Tathagata): He's mister Samhan Lee.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tathagata: I would like to meet a very excellent professors of philosophy</p> <p>Receptionist: Philosophy</p> <p>T: or religion in this university.&nbsp;</p> <p>Soyun: Religion &ndash; Buddhism.</p> <p>Receptionist: Did you make an appointment first?</p> <p>S: We come here to find out do you have such nice philosophers here?

Then I'll explain to you how you can see through which way.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">Professor: What is the goal of our discussion?</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">Tathagata: In order to understand properly about the world of human beings, these things should be informed to people rightly. When people understand how their consciousness system is formed and what is the role of their consciousness, then they don't behave carelessly. Good people build good society. In order to make good people, they need to understand with principle how everything happens in their lives. I'm trying to make people for good. There is one thing very, very difficult for human beings: it is learning. Nobody wants to know the really important thing for them, and everybody tries to teach something for others through only books, but they don't really understand them. When we research something, we need to see something whole. Then we can find exactly the system of what organization do what. But the modern intellectual world tries to find something from every part. They can contribute to develop mechanisms in this way, but they failed already to make people safe, and make the quality of human life better. Recently we have lots of debate about environmental problems on Earth. Yesterday I visited MIT because I wanted to meet somebody in the environmental research center. I requested an interview, but no one wanted to meet me &ndash; they were very alert of me and all had the excuse of being too busy. I absolutely know their research will not be able to contribute to society. We have the phenomenon of global warming (climate change); this phenomenon causes and predicts very serious things to save this present society. The real focus of their research should be the research for gravity. But scientists cannot understand completely yet what is the real role of gravity on this Earth. They don't know how is gravity generated (formed), how gravity keeps itself (preserves itself), and how they have \\\"crack\\\" in the gravity field.</p> <p></p></div> </div>\";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","// Module\nvar code = \"<div class=post> <div class=post_header> <h3>Brief talk with a lay practitioner</h3> </div> <div class=post_body><p style=\\\"\\\">Master Tathagata: The results are the same through meditation or drinking poison.

As long as you are alive, you are influenced by environment. If they understand the nirvana as the end of all the suffering, it means that they finish their life completely.

What is your subject or what have you learned?</p> <p class=p1>Professor: Ah, I study primate cognition. So this is what monkeys and other closely related species know about the world: how they think about the physical world and how they think about the social world.&nbsp;</p> <p class=p1>T: This part is very difficult to understand. I'm wondering what principle do you use for your study. How do you perceive the matters?</p> <p class=p1>P: You mean how do we learn what monkeys know?</p> <p class=p1>Soyun (Korean-English interpreter): Yeah. What principle do you use for your study (research).</p> <p class=p1>P: Well, I guess the principle &ndash; so the intuition we have, the reason we do it &ndash; is to look at the evolution of cognition, so the goal is to really see what our human ancestors looked like. Not just what they looked like but what their cognition was like, what their mind was like, back in the ancestral environment. And the way we do it is to study monkeys, to study closely related primates, to try to see what they know about the world. Maybe I'm not understanding what you mean by 'the principle' exactly.</p> <p class=p1>*Tathagata laughs softly*</p> <p class=p1>P: Yeah? Yeah</p> <p class=p1>T: All the animals has their intuition from their instincts. In order to search this matter, we need a very basic fundamental knowledge. This is very important for researchers: What principle do they apply for their study? Otherwise, they just make up a kind of story that is very distant (remote) from reality. Actually I haven't conversed with animals &ndash; I was not so interested in understanding animals. That's why I don't know about the consciousness of animal. If I don't know about this, then I'm convinced that nobody can understand this matter. However I understand more than 95% of things that human beings can understand.&nbsp;</p> <hr/> <p style=\\\"\\\">[Later]</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">P: What makes human different?

Fruit</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">P: Ah, yes.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">T: Even though they have same plant, but they have very different characters of seeds. Here is a fruit, and it keeps everything in it what happened during its life, and it transmits to another seed for next generation. When we plant a seed, it will make the same fruit (same thing) that it could take from the former generation. If it doesn't meet any other special circumstance or environment then the nature of the seed will not change. One principle applies to plants or animals (same living creature). We have difficulties to examine closely this matter in animals. We cannot observe with our naked eyes the process of movement of the 'motae'. Lots of animals finish their life only with activities of their instinct, not of consciousness.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">S: Before they have consciousness, they only keep their living from their instincts.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">T: All the creatures are born with what is in their 'motae', and they revive from their 'motae'. Even though they didn't form their consciousness but they can be born with their only instincts.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">*Soyun speaks with Tathagata and then laughs briefly*</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">S: I reminded him of your question.

And human beings' 'motae' is formed from what happened in their past lives and what happened is all accumulate in their 'motae'. Suppose there is a person who was always telling untruth</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">S: You know, to tell a lie</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">T: in his past life. When he revives (come to life again), what happened in his past life will form his new 'motae'.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">P: I see. So it's kind of an idea that&hellip; humans have special 'motae' because they bring with them their past lives into new lives, that's what makes us human.</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">S: Yes. Yeah. Everybody has different things in their 'motae'.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">T: What is human beings' 'motae' has great attachment and they try extremely much to keep themselves. Even though somebody lived several hundred years ago, but he or she always told lies, then when they come back to life even five hundred years later, they do same thing.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">P: So they have a&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">S: Yes</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">P: Mm, I understand.

But, it might be quite difficult for you to understand and receive my explanation because this is your first time to contact this knowledge.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">P: Yeah...</p> <p style=\\\"\\\">T: We usually need two years of time to understand what is in the basis and fundament of human beings.

For example, \\\"</span>In-Yeon [special bonds from the past, usually with other people]\\\" or&nbsp;<span style=font-family:inherit>\\\"</span>way [Do, 道]<span style=font-family:inherit>\\\"</span>.<br/> <br/> Also note that there are parenthetical statements in the text, (like this), but that they are part of the original text.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <b>Caution</b><br/> <br/> We the translators took a risk in thinking ourselves qualified to perform this work only due to the theoretical \\\"level of truthfulness\\\" required not to significantly damage the meanings, and because of the actual personal contact with Tathagata – something which we supposed gave us unique preparation. Whether or not this is a true fact is frankly not known to me – especially as I do not speak nor read Korean. I hope that our effort and the fact that I'm sharing it here does not become a precedent for people in the future to think themselves qualified to make accurate translations and call them Tathagata's words. Tathagata – the one who can see – is no longer here to check the result and help us make corrections. Furthermore, we should understand the fact that the true teachings of the historical saints in human history such as Gautama Buddha and Jesus were damaged, deteriorated, and quite literally lost to the point of non-recoverability by those who are not enlightened, through thousands of years through repeated translation.<br/> <br/> A long-time affiliate of Tathagata's who I've known for many years told me, \\\"I don't really approve of retranslating anything - actually I see that as the first stage of erosion. Even if the original has minor flaws, it's easy for someone to think they are making corrections/improvements when they could be adding their own ideas. In time someone else will think it needs correcting and so on and before you know it, it becomes the feeding of the five thousand..\\\" … Later on, after I worked on a translation of the <a href=https://github.com/enlightenmentapp/Translations/blob/master-tmp/TATHAGATA%20-%20Teaching%20-%20Precepts/Precepts%20translated%20by%20J_lee_77777.txt>Precepts</a> given by Tathagata and Tathagata's book <a href=https://github.com/enlightenmentapp/Translations/blob/master-tmp/Books%20-%20Lamentation/Lamentation%20-%20English%20-%20translated%20by%20J_lee_77777.txt>Lamentation</a>, the person told me, \\\"as you know it can never be 100% accurate and there may be a time when someone will translate from the English to another language and then it loses more accuracy, I think it's ok to publish it but put the orginal Korean text next to it so if anyone wants to translate they should be encouraged to do it direct from the Korean and should also be encouraged to put the original korean next to their translation etc..\\\"<br/> <br/> Later, Soyun, who might be called Tathagata's sole disciple, told me, \\\"Even though you give one correct sentence that's better than you do nothing for people. Instead, you should reveal your situation clearly as a translator to protect the readers.\\\"<br/> <br/> Personally, I think I understand the necessity of (or at least the potential for the accomplishment of a good deed in) doing some translations given that certain material remains untranslated – but if you are going to do them, please make sure to provide a conspicuous notice about your level of training and include the name of the translator with the date the translation was done and the source content along with a link to the original webpage.

I was able to attain a good mind from the world.<br/> <br/> What is the good mind that you described?<br/> &gt; It is conscience and courage by way of current expression.<br/> <br/> Do you believe that Buddha's way started with conscience and courage?<br/> &gt; Yes.<br/> <br/> What is this result of the conscience and courage of which you have spoken?<br/> &gt; After I saw conscience, I could take care of myself; after I saw courage, I could live rightly along with the things in the world.<br/> <br/> What is the result of your keeping yourself and taking care of the world?<br/> &gt; I could be free from reincarnation by my virtue, and owing to this, I came to get eternal life.<br/> <br/> Does that mean your body never dies and exists forever?<br/> &gt; No. My body has changed countlessly. However, my soul has never been scattered and has stayed without changing. Thus I could be born again and over again with the original mind. Nevertheless, the reason why my mind could not be Buddha's mind is that my virtue could not reach that of Buddha. When I tried to know Buddha's way, my body got so old that I died. When I was born again, naturally I came to meet another world. Finally as my virtue came to know Buddha's way, the world made me climb over enormous suffering. One of the tests was to let me enjoy wealth and fame. The world made me be born surrounded by alcoholic drink, women, and meat, and seduced me to forget what had happened in my past with affection and music. However, I was not able to be contented in such surroundings. Among people, no one knew the questions which had accumulated in my mind. One day, I happened to see another world which was different from mine. In the world, there were some people of low birth who had come, some people who had become emaciated from hunger, and others who were dying of diseases. It was not until then that I had seen the questions in my mind.<br/> &nbsp; That made me discard my small duty (affection) and hit the road to serve the world's duty (truthfulness). However, there was no one who has known the right way in front of me, and this frustrated mind had to wander around the world. The more I listened to the people, the less I could know truth and facts. Wherever I went, I could not meet any teachers.<br/> &nbsp; At last I got a clue. It was that I hear of things through myself.<br/> &nbsp; Even then, the only thing I knew was confidence. I had such a burning enthusiasm to seek out truth and to accumulate virtue in the world that I could fight against coldness, hunger, loneliness, and despair. However, time resulted in nothing.<br/> &nbsp; At one moment I saw myself having neither will nor expectation for the first time. My body began to be full of the same silence as seen from the world of death. After a while, the message from heaven was heard through my mind. Since that incident, regardless of what I saw in the world, agony has not gather. Even though time went by, fantasy did not arise. It was not until then that I realized that a mind with nothing is Buddha's mind.<br/> &nbsp; However, people did not believe my words, and did not want to follow me either, because they had never seen Buddha before. From that time on, I began to see myself who was lonely and this kind of thing let me know what I should do in the world. Immediately, five desires in myself disappeared, my mind became as bright as clear sky, and when my mind reached all the things in the world, I could see the meaning of them. I started to look for people and to preach the law of cause and effect, and I allowed people to call me a Tathagata.<br/> &nbsp; Now, whoever wants to be the same as I should truly not forget what happened to me, and should know what is right or wrong in themselves. If they want to know the result of all the things in the world, they should understand the law of cause and effect.<br/> &nbsp; Whoever wants to know this law should have the very mind [Buddha’s mind] and it will be possible for them to see the law after having served the world. I should say that a good root [origin] is the origin of Buddha.<br/> <br/>\";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Original Korean Excerpt from Guide -
